### TO HEDGE OR NOT TO HEDGE ?

### Walt Disney’s Yen Financing

### Advantages of Hedging

• Reduce exchange and yen interest rate risks
• Avoid accounting risk and impact on financial result due to exchange rate uncertainty.
• Reduce Disney’s uncertainty risk for its future Japanese cash-flows
• Avoid the « finance drives the corporate strategy » syndrome. Disney should focus on its core business and avoid speculating.

### Advantages of Hedging

Advantages

1. Reduce exchange and Yen interest rate risk.
2. Reduce Disney’s risk on future cash flows.
3. Avoid the « finance drives the corporate strategy syndrome ».

Disney should focus on its core business and avoid speculating.
Looking at historical trends between 1970 and 1980, we can see important volatility in the JPY/USD Forex fluctuations. In the 80’s, fluctuations persisted In 1984-1985, market fluctuations were very important.

### Disadvantages of Hedging

Japan Gross Domestic Product Japan GDP
• Possibility of yen strengthening:
• Japan-USA economic ties were as important as those of China-USA today:
• Import imbalances
• Large exchange rate gap and getting worse (Exhibit 4 shows US CPI is rising faster than Japan CPI which is better for Yen

### What to Hedge & Time Frame

• Disney should determine what will be the cost of hedging in regards to possible FX rate evolutions and maintain low-risk: investors want stability.
• Disney should hedge profit longer than 5 years to limit the amount of short-term liability.:
• In 1985, 75% of ECU Eurobond were 6 to 10 years (bottom of page 3);
• Should be Long-Term to free up credit line.
• A 10 Year bullet loan worth JPY 15 billion is a good solution to Disney’s needs.

### HEDGING SOLUTIONS

Walt Disney’s Yen Financing

Two hedging solutions ruled out
• A new Eurodollar debt issue with longer maturity swapped into yen:
• recent Eurodollar note issue and high debt ratio
• Issuing Euroyen bonds:
• Disney ineligible to such issue under Japanese Ministry of Finance guidelines

##### Disadvantages

• Liquidity : no liquid market for options with maturity of 2 years or more
• Cost : Higher spreads (lack of liquidity and the long maturity)
• Complexity : options require a good knowledge and strong observation and maintenance
• Time decay : options are really sensitive to time and options owners lose the time value of the options as they hold them

#### Forwards

##### Advantages

• Tailor-made: can be tailored to Disney requirements (terms and size)
• Longer term contracts : allow Disney to hedge their position up to 10 years
• More flexible than a swap : contract can be renewed or not every year

##### Disadvantages

• An Obligation, not a right
• Difficulty to find a counterparty due to tailor-made characteristics
• Locked rate at the time of contract : possible upside benefit

### SWAP BASICS

Walt Disney’s Yen Financing

The currency swap market
ORIGINS
Initially created in the 1970’s to avoid foreign-exchange controls in the UK. UK companies had to pay a premium to borrow in US Dollars. To avoid it, set made agreements with US companies wishing to borrow Sterling.
Always keep in mind that what investors fear most is uncertainty. Further reasons for using currency swaps:

### Hedging:

For both parties involved in contracts Lock in long-term exchange rates Exploit the comparative advantage of the other currency in obtaining debt financing Flexible, low cost of transaction

#### Winners & Losers

@execution of swap Initially, both firms benefit from hedging positions: they have agreed on forward rates that seem fair. Furthermore, the swap bank(s) benefit(s) from the swap margin (fee).
@settlement At maturity, forward rates rarely match effective market rates. Therefore, there is a counterparty that overpaid and another one that benefitted from the swap. Example: Firm A agrees to sell EUR 1 million in exchange for USD. Settlement is due in one month at agreed forward rate of 1.150. Effective spot rate at settlement: 1.2 Opportunity cost: (1.2-1.150)*1m = 50 000 USD
All-in-all
Both parties can take advantage of having contracted the swap. Thanks to the swap, they benefit from the currency they needed at any time of the duration of the swap (for instance : an investment, a payback…).

#### Value & Risks implied by Swaps

Value of a swap

1. Provides availability of funds at a required time and at a low cost.
2. For one party, value created by favorable move of the spot rate atsettlement date
3. Certainty of the rates (if fixed rates) is an advantage for financial planning
   Market Risk
   1. Price Risk: Arises due un derlying index movements
   2. Interest Risk: Occurs when the exchange is combined with an IRS Counterparty Risk
   3. Default Risk: If Counterparty defaults, it would not be able to meet the contractual obligations. Operational Risk
   4. Corporations do not make good use of the cash flows provided by the swap.

### PROPOSALS

Walt Disney’s Yen Financing

### Proposals

• Disney has the possibility to choose between two proposals:
• A JPY term-loan;
• A ECU Eurobond issue linked to a ECU/JPY currency swap.
• In the following slides, we are going to analyze which is the best solution.

#### Proposal 1 – JPY Term-Loan

• Principle: JPY 15 Billion
• At time 0: ¥15 Billion – (0.75% fee) = ¥14.8875 Billion
• 10 Year Maturity
• Coupon payment of 7.5% semi-annual = ¥ 562.5 Million
Yield to Maturity = 7.61%
Principal 15 000
Interest rate 0,0375

#### Proposal 2 – ECU Bond & JPY Swap

• Principle: ECU 80 Million
• Semi-annual rate: 9.125%
• $75 000 fee=ECU101 078
• 2% Underwriting fee
• IRR computed from Yen cash flow swap

### Summary of Proposals

Walt Disney
• JPY Term-Loan: 7.61% (all-in cost)
• JPY swap : 6.89% (Goldman’s proposal, Exhibit 7, column B) SAVINGS: 72 bps French Utility
• Current ECU cost: 9.37% (Exhibit 8, row 14, column 8)
• ECU cost: 9.187% (Goldman’s proposal, Exhibit 7, column C) SAVINGS: 18 bps

#### Outright forward

• We use the forward rate formula to get the JPY implied rate.
• Since the average implied JPY rate is 8,11%, we can say that compared to the ECU Bond + ECU/JPY currency swap, Walt Disney saved 123 bps. Outright Forwards

### Conclusion

• Both Disney and the French utility have an interest in making the swap.
• Without the swap, Disney seems to have the highest borrowing cost in Yen (7.61%) and in ECU (9.473%) compared to the French Utility (9.37% in ECU and 6.89% in Yen).
• However, if Disney accepts the swap they benefits from it since Yen IRR becomes 6.89% for a saving of 72 bps. Eventually both companies will benefit from the currency swap.
