2 – Trading Strategies (1/3)
▪ Convergence trade strategy: short an asset and long
another because you expect that prices will converge.
▪ Quantitative approach:
▪ Hoped for convergence between long-term off-the-run (old issuance)
and on-the-run (newly issued) US treasury bonds.
▪ Played convergence on European, Japanese and US sovereign bonds
and among European bonds:
▪ Italian Lira treasury bill rates versus Lira Libor
▪ Equity arbitrage:
▪ Convergence of stocks of two companies announcing they will merge.

2 – Limits to these Strategies (2/3)
▪ Convergence trade often gives profit as long as price
variations are “normal”:
▪ No external choc (forgot about 1973 oil crisis, 1987 crash)
▪ Two founders of LTCM received « Nobel Economic Prize » in 1997
(Merton and Scholes) for « new method to determine the value of
derivatives »
▪ Profits on these trades are extremely low. Therefore,
these trades have to be leveraged to make large profits.
▪ In early 1998, LTCM had USD 5 billion in equity and had borrowed
USD 125 billion (leverage of 25:1)

2 – Off-putting features (3/3)
▪ Fees of LTCM were extremely high:
▪ Entry ticket to LTCM: USD 10 million.
▪ Fees: 2% of invested capital + 25% of investment profits.
▪ Fund would only start activity when USD 1 billion would have been
collected.
▪ Leverage made the fund very risky
▪ Therefore, « hedge fund » is a misnomer.

▪
Believed the US capital market was mature
▪
Opportunities for arbitrage profits had lessened
▪
Higher risks and volatility
US Treasury
swap-spread
July 1998
▪
LTCM’s strategy was to short US Treasury bonds in exchange for
a fixed IRS of Libor + 62 bps
▪
Spread change due to unwindings and not technical changes
3 – Movements & Effects (1/3)
Russian
default
▪
August 17, 1998 - Russian government defaulted on its own
ruble denominated bonds – MARKET SHOCK
▪
LTCM did not have a big exposure but did suffer a loss.
Black Friday
August 21, 1998
« worst day in the history of the Fund »
▪
US swap widened by 19 bps, compared to less than 1 bps on a
normal day (linked to Russian default)
▪
International panic: « rush to liquidity » and “flight-to-quality”
▪
Panicked investors sold Japanese and European bonds to buy US Treasury
bonds.
▪
LTCM has important short positions and suffered important losses both on US
Treasury and UK Gilt swaps. Profits that were supposed to occur as the value
of the bonds converged turned into huge losses as the value of the bonds
diverged.
▪
Tellabs acquisition of Ciena Corp. cancelled
▪
LTCM suffered a big arbitration loss as spread between the two companies
widened while LTCM was expecting a convergence of both stock-prices.
TOTAL LOSS FOR THE DAY: USD 550 Million of LTCM

3 – Movements & Effects (2/3)
Principles
Meeting
August23,1998
▪
Managers kept reducing risk
▪
Other market players were also doing the same thing at any price: caused
market disruptions
▪
Fund still had USD 4.08 Million of Working Capital (USD 2.95 BN in equity, USD
230 MM in equity and USD 900 MM in a credit facility)
▪
Bear Stearns, a clearing agent, started to worry on LTCM’s
exposures: asked LTCM to keep extra cash within Bear Stearns
▪
Doubts on creditworthiness
▪
LTCM was forced to liquidate to meet margin calls
▪
Net Asset Value continued to decline, fell below USD 1.5 billion
▪
Covenants on the syndicate credit facility could be triggered at any time

3 – Movements & Effects (1/3)
The market situation could not be considered normal anymore.
Too many
shocks had affected financial markets in a short period of time. Principles of
LTMC should have understood that their strategy was not working anymore, it
wasn’t adapted to the current financial markets.

4 – Risk Management (1/2)
Pre-Crisis Risk Management
▪ Complex theoretical
market: risk models
▪ Hedging of long and short
positions:
▪ US swap spread
▪ Interest only strip
▪ Selling stock-index volatility
▪ Others
Crisis Risk Management
▪ Decreased position of the
least attractive risk-to-
reward ratios in June
▪ Additional cut of 5% in
August
▪ Salomon Smith disbanded
US bond arbitrage group.

4 – Prevention & limit of losses (1/2)

Mistake 1
Eliminated investments that were les profitable, too high
leverage (31:1)
▪
Prevention:
▪
Selling off less-liquid positions
▪
Raising fresh capital
▪
Lower leverage ratio

Mistake 2
Used recent history to estimate risk and underestimated it
▪
Prevention:
▪
Take into account major events such as sovereign defaults and market
disruptions
▪
Aggressively stress test the investment model

Mistake 3
Fund was not diversified enough
▪
Prevention:
▪
Invest in positions that do not share the same risk (i.e. liquidity and default risk)

LTCM BENEFICIARIES

6 – Could it happen again ?
▪ Hedge Fund investments become less unregulated
▪ July 2010 – Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Act
▪ Hedge funds with more than USD 150 million in assets must register with the SEC
▪ Overseas hedge funds with 15 or more US investors and managing at least USD 25 million have to
register with the SEC
▪ Have to provide information about their trades and portfolios
▪
Destined to help regulators fulfill their obligation to monitor and regulate systemic risk
▪ November 2010 – EU Directive on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (for 2013)
▪ Hedge Fund managers have to register with national regulatory authorities
▪ Disclose investment strategies information on a more frequent basis:
▪
Hedge funds could have to hold larger amounts of capital
▪
Leverage could be peaked
▪ Currently markets are highly volatile
▪ Q3 2011 – Worst quarter for hedge funds since 2008
▪ Almost every type of investment is affected (Hedge Fund Research – FT 10/10/11)
▪ Volatility could provoke liquidity issues for hedge funds
▪ Liquidity is crucial, it provoked the fall of Lehman Brothers
▪ Advantage Plus (John Paulson fund) is down 47% year-to-date

6 – Could it happen again ?
▪ After LTCM’s demise, Hedge Funds deleveraged. However, other
hedge funds experienced the same situation as LTCM (Amaranth
Advisors in 2006).
▪ Governments and Regulators have realized the importance of
regulating all market players including hedge funds. However, in the
past regulations have proven to be inefficient.
▪ Human greed
