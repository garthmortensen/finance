# Money and Capital Markets

## Session 5

**ID 3 EDHEC alumni or personal acquaintances working in the financial markets industry with different jobs. Check the websites of their companies (or discuss with them) and describe their jobs in a few lines.**

One person works as a senior project manager for the Paris Region Economic Development Agency. The agency helps companies looking to invest in the Paris region by easing their entry into the market. This particular fellow promotes China’s inbound investments and business development. This is done by providing consultancy and sales and marketing. A large part of his job revolves around communication and presentation.

Another person finds their job as a rater for an insurance company “super boring.” The company provides many lines of insurance, such as fire and casualty, and is a partner with Lloyds. This person works as a silent partner with the underwriter. They enter information into the system that the agent submits from a client. This in turn generates an insurance policy, the end (Note to self - do not work for an underwriter).

The third person works as a broker for clients looking to invest in the market. As the vice president of the small company, she oversees everything from marketing to new hires. She deals directly with the larger clients, giving recommendations and advice for how they should invest. She finds that working with “good old boys” in the southwestern US limits her opportunities and wishes to venture off on her own, where she is not limited by office politics. 

I have contacted many more people and hope to find more optimistic feedback in the near future. This is a good exercise.

## Session 6

**When Enron went bust, which securities did it have issued in the market? Who owned them (roughly)? How much did investors get back?**

Its settlement includes 1.5 million individuals and entities such as pension funds, and employees.

It had issued common, preferred, preferred convertible, and junior voting preferred convertible stock. It also issued mandatorily convertible single reset preferred stock, both series A and B.

Some indentures were also floating out there, between Enron and the Harris Trust and Savings Bank, (now the Bank of New York). It had also issued two supplemental indentures, between Enron and Enron Oregon, which was entrusted by the same bank. A third and fourth were issued, though both excluded Enron Oregon.

In July 2003, Enron announced a bankruptcy plan that would pay about 20 percent of the USD 63 billion it owed to creditors. Later in July 2004, a New York judge approved USD 12 billion to be paid to creditors. 

## Session 7

**Download the latest Shell financial report. Which derivative contracts are mentioned? Where do you find them? What were they entered for?** 

For its 2010 annual financial statement, Shell details its derivative positions in Section 23 - Financial Instruments and Other Derivative Contracts.

The company entered into many derivative contracts to hedge risks, of which the company faces many. The main fears stem from possible losses due to movements in interest rates, currencies, and commodity prices. 

However, “Apart from forward foreign exchange contracts to meet known commitments,” they say, most subsidiaries don’t use derivatives.

Shell uses interest and currency rate swaps to convert its debt into floating rate, in order to float its interest rate exposure. It does this because most of its debt is raised through barrowing programs. 

Shell mainly operates in a dollar environment, so it needs to make sure its operations are protected from swings in the dollar foreign exchange rate. Upstream operations deal with international trade and thus dollars. Downstream however, most transactions are based on local currencies. Though elaborate explanation of this risk is made in the financial section, none of it seems to be hedged.

Price risk is one place Shell actively works to minimize with derivatives. Nearly all prices in the industrial chain seem to be managed with hedging, using swaps, options and futures. In order to maintain sound liquidity, the company also invests in short-dated money market instruments.

The back of this page provides supplementary tables:

The table below shows what derivative contracts the company has outstanding from 2010: 

And this one shows their maturities with their carrying amounts:
