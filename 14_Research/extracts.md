**A comparison of GARCH models for VaR estimation**

The results reveal that the ARCH speciﬁcation is the best per-former followed by GARCH(1,1) and the Student’s t distribution is slightly better than the Normal.

ARCH performs the best of all specifications, followed by GARCH. The Student’s t distribution slightly outperforms the normal. 

One obligation on ﬁrms and portfoliomanagers to survive in the competitive global markets is the management of risk. Markowitz (1959) had mentioned the importance of close relation between portfolio selection and risk.

Markowitz highlighted the important relationship between portfolio selection and risk.

ARCH/GARCH models, introduced to the literature by Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1986), have emerged more recently to re-solve such problems of clustering in ﬁnancial data. These models condition on heteroskedasticity to keep track of and manage changing volatility.

Although, researchers used to employ the traditional Nor-mal distribution of GARCH models for a long time due its ease in practical use, high frequency ﬁnancial data are proven to have thick tails and Student’s t distribution is addressed to be more capable of representing these series. But still, literature about the more appropriate distribution to use reveal blended conclusions.

Researchers have long relied on the traditional normal distribution of GARCH models thanks to their ease of use. However, research and empirical evidence on distribution choice later showed that non-normal better describe series. Nonetheless, there remains some room for interpretation on which distribution is best.

Research on the distribution front led to improvements over the Normal distribution.

This paper uses themost comprehensive list of GARCH speciﬁca-tions in the literature so far to form up a complete set of GARCH models possible, with the intention of ranking the GARCH models and distributions based on their performances in shaping the VaR figures.

The global ﬁnancial crisis is intentionally selected as a litmus test to assess the performances of different GARCH speciﬁcations under stress times.

\1. The best performer of all 16 speciﬁcations is the ARCH model. Although there are competing speciﬁcations for different coun-tries, conﬁdence levels and distributions, ARCH always achieves to be a top estimator, may be the ﬁrst for many cases. GARCH(1,1) was addressed as the best performer in estimating volatility of out-of-sample forecasts by Hansen and Lunde (2005) where they ask ‘‘Does anything Beat a GARCH(1,1)?’’ in the title of their paper in a somewhat different study, accord-ing to our demonstrations ARCH speciﬁcation is better to return VaR ﬁgures.

These authors found that ARCH often ranked first in many tests, and overall outperformed all other specifications. Hansen and Lunde (2005) found that GARCH(1,1) performed best for estimating out-of-sample forecasts.

\2. The t-distribution returns slightly better estimates than the Normal. But it is surprising to see the worst performing speciﬁ-cations have t worse than the normal.

T-distribution surpasses normal only slightly, and is sometimes beaten by the latter.

**A comparison of volatility models**

Our objective is to evaluate whether the evolu-tion of volatility models has led to better forecasts of volatility when compared to the ﬁrst “species” of volatility models.

Volatility models, now counting over 330, have greatly evolved since the first species. 

Although we estimated 330 different models we have not entirely exhausted the space of volatility models

We make an out-of-sample comparison of 330 different volatility models using daily exchange rate data (DM/$) and IBM stock prices. Our analysis does not point to a single winner amongst the different volatility models, as it is different models that are best at forecasting the volatility of the two types of assets. Interestingly, the best models do not provide a signiﬁcantly better forecast than the GARCH(1,1) model. This result is estab-lished by the tests for superior predictive ability of White (2000) and Hansen (2001). If an ARCH(1) model is selected as the benchmark, it is clearly outperformed.

ARCH(1) is easily outperformed.

Time-variation in the conditional variance of ﬁnancial time-series is important when pricing derivatives, calculating measures of risk, and hedging against portfolio risk.

Allowing for conditional variance allows for better pricing of derivatives, measuring risk, and hedging portfolios. 

**On choosing a GARCH model, and its specifications.**

The fact that the conditional variance is unobserved has affected the development of volatil-ity models and has made it difﬁcult to evaluate and compare the different models. Therefore the models with poor forecasting abilities have not been identiﬁed, and this may explain why so many models have been able to coexist. In addition, there does not seem to be a natural and intuitive way to model conditional heteroskedasticity – different models attempt to capture different features that are thought to be important. For example, some models allow the volatil-ity to react asymmetrically to positive and negative changes in returns. Features of this kind are typically found to be very signiﬁcant in in-sample analyses. However, the signiﬁcance maybe a result of a misspeciﬁcation, and it is therefore not certain that the models with such fea- tures result in better out-of-sample forecasts, compared to the forecasts of more parsimonious models.

There exists a large assortment of models designed to capture conditional hetereoskedacticity. Some allow for asymmetric reactions to positive and negative return changes. These types are typical of in-sample analysis. However, since asymmetries may result from misspecification, more parsimonious models are opted for when forecasting to avoid throwing results.

The observed leverage effect motivated the development of models that allowed for an asymmetric response in volatility to positive and negative shocks. The leverage effect was ﬁrst noted in Black (1976), and suggests that stock returns are negatively correlated with changes in return volatility. This implies that volatility should tend to rise in response to bad news, (deﬁned as returns that are lower than expected), and should tend to fall after good news. For further details on the leverage effect, see Engle and Patton (2000).

There is not a unique criterion for selecting the best model; rather it will depend on preferences.

Since there is no way to determine which model is best, selection rests on preference.

But in the out-of-sample comparison, the models with more lags rarely perform better than the same model with fewer lags

But that’s not to say it’s all left to the Gods. According to XXX, models with more lags rarely outperform the same models with fewer lags. 

For the exchange rate data the GARCH(1,1) seems to be able to capture the variation in the conditional variance. Its performance is not statistically worse than any of the competing models. For the IBM data the answer is less obvious.

**Against complex GARCH models**

In contrast to the ARCH(1), we do not ﬁnd much evidence that the GARCH(1,1) model is outperformed. When the family of competing models are compared to the GARCH(1,1) model, we cannot reject that none of the competing models are better than the GARCH(1,1). This is somewhat surprising, because the GARCH(1,1) model corresponds to a simple news impact curve, and a GARCH(1,1) process cannot generate a leverage effect.

In their study of xx models, xxx found none of the worthwhile competitors (adversaries) fared better than the simple GARCH(1,1), despite its inability to capture the leverage effect.

**REIT**

After the financial crisis broke, sourcing funds became the top problem in China’s real estate sector. Many mainland developers were grappling with funding woes up until late last year when government officials eventually relaxed bank credit terms. Nevertheless, it seems clear that greater diversification of financing sources would be beneficial to the long-term stability of the real estate industry; the emergence of real estate investment trusts, or REITs, in China is one such alternative.

The financial crisis dried up much of the financing available to China’s real estate sector, shaking it awake to the need for more sources to draw from. 

Recent official announcements have indicated that China’s REIT legislation may come to fruition in the near future, although no specific timeline is available yet for when the regulations will be issued.

While government ministries are considering both retail and institutional REIT models, it seems likely that the latter may be pursued first.But given the Chinese government’s wish to broaden sources of financing for real estate companies, allowing REITs to invest or co-invest in development projects could make it easier to bring funds to the table.In addition, the government will likely restrict REITs initially to domestic Chinese investors only. As the market develops, however, foreign investors may want to participate and this will raise more tax issues, particularly over how REIT distributions will be treated under China’s double tax treaties.There is also a question over whether Chinese REITs will be permitted to invest outside of the mainland. This could have particular relevance to foreign investors who might wish to exit from an investment in China by selling to a Chinese REIT.

Institutional, before retail, REITs may be coming to the table soon.

**Research on Spillover Effects**

Again in the current international financial crisis, it is being closely watched that how deeply China’s market affected by the financial crisis and the role making a major contribution to stabilizing the global financial situation. Both GARCH and Granger causality test are used to measure the volatility spillover in the existent literatures. However, in case of the correlations of some markets are not linear relationship, Copula functions have recently become popular.

China’s role in stabilizing the global financial situation has adorned it with much deserved attention. 

The main findings are that Shanghai market is not affected by New York market significantly in the financial crisis, it can not exert on significant influence to New York market as well. The similar degree of market efficiency, the similar attitude about considering on risk and earnings are more important on leading to the spillover effect in stock markets than the real economic link between Shanghai market and New York market.

Tests indicate that the Shanghai and New York markets do not significantly affect each other. 

A significant decrease in asset prices and increase in market volatility usually indicates a financial crisis. However, this kind of financial risk can be transmitted from one market to the others due to the markets integrating and the other spillover channels. The volatility spillover effect is the primary process to transmit the financial risk. If there is a significant difference between two stock markets during the periods before and after the shock, namely, if the nature of the relationship between the two markets was altered by a certain financial event, especially a financial crisis, it would be considered as the volatility spillover effect of the two markets.

Two channels exist for a financial crisis to spread: asset prices, which tells of integration, and volatility, which tells of spillovers. 

**Portfolio allocation**

the systemic risk among different markets is also an important decision making element. Information about correlation between returns and risks of different markets becomes necessary in the course of risk evaluating or portfolios choosing. In case the original condition of constant correlation is violated due to the financial shock, the volatility spillover effect should have direct influence on portfolio performance and risk management.

Again in the current international financial crisis, it is being closely watched that how deeply China’s market affected by the financial crisis and the role making a major contribution to stabilizing the global financial situation. So the market information transmission and the cross-market volatility transmission on the internal and external market of China become a key problem.

Based on those phenomena, we want to know how do co-movement changes between Chinese markets and the other markets abroad compare before and after the financial crisis? How do changes among the Chinese mainland internal markets compare before and after the financial crisis? Did Shanghai stock market really receive a volatility spillover from the crisis, especially while its indices were transforming dramatically between bear market and bull market conditions? What influence do the Shanghai markets exert on the other markets? 

Both GARCH and Granger causality test are used to measure the volatility spillover in the existent literatures. However, in case of the correlations of some markets are not linear relationship, Granger causality test has a certain limitation. Copula functions have recently become popular in the finance literature due to a number of reasons.

GARCH and Granger causality tests are two common tools in measuring volatility spillover. But Granger tests lose their relevance when market correlations aren’t linear. When this is the case, copula functions oft prove useful. 

King and Wadhwani (1990), Lee and Kim (1993), and Calvo and Reinhart (1996) reach the conclusion that financial contagion was indeed present during every major financial and economic crisis in the last decade or so.

Financial contagion was present in all of the past decade’s major financial and economic crises.

**Explaining spillover**

Calvo and Reinhart (1996) enriched the set of theoretical sources of contagion. They have examined “spillover” or “contagion” effect in light of the Mexican crisis in December 1994. They pointed out that institutional practice also could be a channel of spillovers. Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz (1995) explain the contagion effect by the "bandwagon" effects as herding behavior in which investor’s sentiment does not discriminate among different macroeconomic fundamentals across countries. Calvo and Reinhart (1996) find regional preferences of foreign investors lead to the contagion, implying that investors first select the larger, usually better known, countries as a place to invest. Ades and Chua (1993), Easterly and Levine (1994), explain the contagion effect by real links. Ades and Chua (1993) think the correlated trade patterns and arrangements are important factors to cause the contagion. Easterly and Levine (1994) explain the contagion effect by technological factors and political instability. Hoffmaister and Végh, Talvi, (1994) provide a financial explanation about the contagion effect because of highly integrated capital markets. 

A number of theories have been put forth to illuminate the sources contagion. Eichengreen, Rose and Wyplosz (1995) highlight a “bandwagon” effect where …

Ades and Chua (1993) point out that trade patterns and arrangements are crucial elements. Easterly and Levine (1994) later looked to technological and political instability. Hoffmaister and Végh, Talvi, (1994) meanwhile sought explanation in how integrated capital markets have become.

Daily closing index values for the Chinese Exchanges, including Shanghai market (SSE) and Shenzhen market (SZ), New York Exchange (S&P500), London (FTSE 100), and Hong Kong Exchange (HSI) are collected from Yahoo Finance and CCER database for the period from 07/2005 to 04/2010. The software of Mathworks Matlab 2009a is used to compute the arithmetic and the models. The long sample period overall from 07/2005 to 04/2010 is chosen in order to examine the effect of the financial crisis on the stock markets, as well as on the dynamic relationship between Chinese markets and the primary stock market during the periods before and after the shock.

The two price series were drawn from Yahoo Finance, and range from October 2001 to February 2012. The long sample period was employed in order to cover the markets both before and after the worst of the financial crisis. Microsoft Excel 2010 was used to clean and filter the adjusted closing prices to remove all but shared trading days. Mathwords MATLAB 2009a was used for the arithmetic and modeling. 

It is difficult to construct a multidimensional probability density function which includes dependence measures between more than two variables.

**Do bears and bulls swim across oceans**

This study investigates returns and volatilities transmission across Greater China’s four emerging stock markets and three developed international markets, Tokyo, London, and New York.

Studies on international stock markets’ interdependencies have been concentrated on analyzing how news from one stock market inﬂuences other markets’ performances. For example, applying a two-step procedure and GARCH type models, Hamao et al. (1990)…

Liu and Pan (1997) investigate the mean and volatility spillover effects from the US and Japan to Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. They ﬁnd that the US market is more inﬂuential than the Japanese market in transmitting returns and volatilities to the four Asian markets. In contrast to Liu and Pan (1997),Masih andMasih (1999) provide strong support for the view that the Asian stock markets ﬂuctuations are explained mostly by regional markets rather than by the advanced markets.

Liu and Pan (1997) find that the US is more influential than Japan in transmitting returns and volatilities to Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. Masih and Masih (1999) rendered counterevidence showing that regional Asian market fluctuations are more explained by regional markets than advanced ones.

Greater China’s ﬁnancial markets are among the largest emerging ﬁnancial markets in the world and so studies on information transmission between Greater China and the major international ﬁnancial markets will be valuable in helping design optimal global portfolios. Surprisingly, however, there are few studies that examine the information transmission mechanism between the ﬁnancial markets of Greater China and developed countries. In particular, little attention has been paid to information transmissions between the newMainland China stock markets and other more established markets. Given the large size of the Mainland market (more than 1100 listed ﬁrms) and its rapid opening-up to foreign investors, much more research is needed. Our study seeks to remedy this gap in the literature.

China is the largest emerging economy, and one of the largest emerging financial markets in the world. This renders it a prime choice for any global portfolio. Understanding just how volatility transfers to and fro its markets is therefor of utmost and growing importance. But within the niche area of Chinese volatility spillovers studies, the lions share focus on Hong Kong or Taiwan, both diminishing in their relative economic importance. Studies specifically focusing on the real estate sector can be meanwhile counted on one hand.

The four Greater China exchanges examined in this study are linked together because of economic and business ties but they are quite different in terms of the degree of market openness, transparency, and maturity. Both Hong Kong and Taiwan are among theChineseMainland’s largest economic partners in theworld in terms of import and export trading and foreign direct investment (FDI) inﬂows. The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong is one of the largest emerging stock markets, while the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange are among the youngest stock markets in the world. The Taipei Stock Exchange has a relatively large stockmarket in terms of transaction volume, although itmight be themost isolated stockmarket among the fourChinesemarkets due to political reasons.

The October 1997 Asian ﬁnancial crisis has attracted signiﬁcant interest into howﬁnancial information transfers fromtheAsianmarkets to the rest of the world. In this study, we use a recent sample period which covers both the pre- and post-Asian ﬁnancial crisis eras. This partitioning enables us to examine whether there is a structural change in the information transmission mechanism between Greater China’s stock markets and the rest of the world around the time of the Asian ﬁnancial crisis.

As Greater China’s stock markets usually close for a week or more during the Lunar New Year holidays, usually in late January or early February, the data of the three international ﬁnancial markets for these periods are eliminated, also. Similarly, other holidays’ data are also excluded from the sample. The number of trading days for each index is 1414.

**Data summary**

Table 1 reports some basic statistics for daily close-to-close returns, daytime returns and overnight returns for the seven stock indices over the sample period. As we expected, the emerging stock markets, SZ and SH, have the highest mean close-to-close returns and the highest volatilitiesmeasured by standard errors of the returns. The high volatilities of the two ChinaMainland markets are explained by the newness of the markets, the type of investors, and the information and regulatory environment. Stock market participants are dominated by retail or private investors who have limited knowledge of ﬁnancial matters, investment decisions are often based on rumor, and regulation is both arbitrary and relatively lax.

XXX expect that emerging markets exhibit higher volatilities than developed ones. This holds true when comparing the indices used in this study, but the difference isn’t as remarkable. XXX explain their predictions on the newness of the markets, investor types, and the information and regulatory environment. They claim that the market is dominated by unsophisticated retail investors, and regulation is weak. I don’t know if this carries to real estate.

**Volatility cause**

Public and private information, trading noise, and trading mechanisms have been identiﬁed as important determinants of stock return volatilities (Chan et al., 1996).

Return volatility is determined by public and private information, trading noise, and trading mechanisms (Chan et al. 1996).

**Test first for hetero volatility**

The Ljung and Box (1978) test statistics, LB(k) and LB2(k) for k = 4 and 8 lags, are used to test for serial correlation in the return and squared-return series. The null hypothesis of no serial correlation is rejected at the 5% level for most of the return series and the squared-return series in Table 1. These results indicate that most of the return series exhibit conditional heteroskedasticity and that a GARCH type model will be an appropriate speciﬁcation.

**asymmetric**

The standard GARCH model is symmetric in its response to past innovations. However, there are theoretical arguments that suggest a different response in conditional variance to past positive and negative innovations. In support of this, previous empirical studies indi- cate that “good” news and “bad” news give different forecasts of future volatility.

In the above models, we also include a dummy variable for the October 1997 Asian ﬁnancial crisis. The Asian ﬁnancial crisis began to emerge on 2 July 1997 when Thailand abandoned its currency (Baht) peg to the US dollar.

A dummy variable to test for before and after crisis!!!

We also ﬁnd that there are no one-period lagged return spillover effects from the three advanced markets to Chinese markets, except Taiwan. This implies that the Chinese markets adjust to information from the UK and US markets in an efﬁcient manner. Finally, while the volatilities of most of the sample stock market indices have signiﬁcant asymmetric coefﬁcients, Mainland China’s two stock markets, SH and SZ, are not affected by both contemporaneous and delayed “bad news”. The overall ﬁndings provide evidence to support the viewthat theChinese stockmarkets are partially integratedwith the international stock markets.

Results? China is integrated.

**EDHEC Working paper - Conditional correlations and real estate-1**

The paper studies the temporal variations in the conditional correlations between REIT returns and equity, bond and commodity returns. First, the correlations between REITs and equity returns rose over the period analyzed, while the correlations with bonds and commodities fell. Second, the correlations with REITs rose especially in periods of above average volatility in equity and bond markets. 

The correlation between REITs and equity returns rose. REIT correlation rose particularly quickly when the equity and bond markets become particularly volatile. 

As Chan et al. (1998) note, institutional investment increased substantially in the 1990’s and a positive relationship exists between this and REIT performance. This process has continued and the inclusion of REITs in the Standard & Poor’s indices in 2001 was a further step in increased investor acceptance of the sector.

Institutional investment seems to have driven some of the REIT performance (Chan et al, 1998). Further, when REITs were included in S&P indices in 2001, investors seemed more comfortable with them and their performance stepped up once more.

The data used in this paper consists of daily returns for the period January 1, 1990, through December 30, 2005, totaling 4,000 observations. During this time, the popularity of REITs has expanded dramatically with massive growth in investor awareness and interest focusing on the return and volatility characteristics of the sector.

She points out that the popularity of REITs grow greatly, and investors became more aware and interested in their characteristics.

By far the most successful volatility forecasting model is the GARCH(1,1) (Hansen and Lunde, 2005), developed by Bollerslev (1986). As with the GARCH(1,1) model, coefficients of the DCC(1,1) model are estimated by the maximum likelihood procedure using the algorithm of BFGS.

**Estimation of value-at-risk for energy commodities**

Crude oil has provided the bulk of global energy needs since the end of the nineteenth century. Energy expenditures account for a large proportion of GDP in most industrial nations. Jones and Kaul (1996) indicated that energy expenditure reached as high as 14% of GDP in the U.S. during the 1980s. Sadorsky (1999) found that oil price volatility shocks have asymmetric effects on the economy. That is, changes in oil prices affect economic activity, but changes in economic activity have little impact on oil prices. Therefore, oil price fluctuations have large macroeconomic impacts. However, political events often affect oil prices, causing enormous volatility.

He says energy expenditures are huge. So are housing. And they account for a large proportion of GDP. 

To the best of our knowledge, most empirical studies dealing with VaR calculation focused on market risk in stock and foreign exchange markets (Brooks and Persand, 2002; Giot and Laurent, 2003b, 2004; Huang and Lin, 2004; Chiu et al., 2005). In contrast, relatively few studies have attempted to measure market risk for energy commodities. In fact, price fluctuations for energy commodities not only have a significant macroeconomic impact but also affect financial markets.

In fact, price fluctuations in real estate don’t only have a significant social impact but also affect financial markets.

**Volatility risk**

For long positions, the risk comes from a drop in the price of the commodity, meaning that the traders merely concerned with the downside of the returns distribution, especially the tailed distribution. Among empirical researches, the unconditional distribution of asset returns is often found to be non-normal, even after the second moment is modeled by the GARCH process (Bollerslev, 1987; Bekaert et al., 1998).

Someone invested long in real estate fears that prices will fall and they’ll lose their shirt. For the purposes of this study, it also means the investor is only worried about the downside of the returns distribution.

**Global and regional spillovers in emerging stock markets**

The empirical ﬁnance literature aboundswith studies of cross-border links in stockmarket returns. This is not surprising. Empirical modelling of such links is relevant for trading and hedging strategies and provides insights into the transmission of shocks (news) across markets. Informed by standard asset pricing models and supported by advances in the econometric modelling of volatility, research in the past two decades has focused on interdependencies in terms of both ﬁrst and second moments of return distributions.

Models which show the cross-border links between stock markets are crucial for trading and hedging strategies. They can also tell of how news transmits across markets. Recent econometric advances over the past two decades have allowed researchers to expand these models. It’s now possible to delve into both the first and second moments of return distributions. 

Early studies of spillovers across national stock markets primarily covered advanced countries. Prompted by the October 1987 stock market crash in the US, Hamao et al. (1990), King and Wadhwani (1990) and Schwert (1990) examined spillovers across major markets before and after the crash.

And those studies were introduced just in time, as the October 1987 stock market crash in the US prompted a flurry of spillover studies.

In the multivariate GARCH(1,1)-BEKK representation proposed by Engle and Kroner (1995), which guarantees by construction that the variance–covariance matrices in the system are positive deﬁnite, Ht takes the following form:

**Intra- and inter-regional spillovers**

On the one hand, we expect strong cultural links, common business conditions, and trade relations within a given region to encourage intra-regional integration. On the other hand, the global trend in technological progress and towards liberalization should give rise to inter-regional spillovers (Kaminsky and Rainhart, 2000; Pritsker, 2001; Gelos and Sahay, 2001; Pericoli and Sbracia, 2003). In addition,we analyze howquickly foreign news is assimilated by local markets.

XXX expect strong cultural links, common business conditions, and trade relations to tighten market intra-regional integration. Further, technology and liberalization should increase the magnitude inter-regional spillovers (xxxx).

**Why its important**

The study of spillovers between emerging capital markets deserves special attention because of several important effects resulting frominternational integration. Themost striking phenomena are decreasing, but still considerable, average returns, increasingly correlated international stock price movements, and rising beta factors of the national markets with the world market. Although these developments mirror the decreasing risk of investing on emerging markets, they also reduce the scope of international portfolio diversiﬁcation (Bekaert and Harvey, 2000, 2003).

International integration seems to be an irreversible force. With it comes decreasing average returns, increasingly correlated price movements across markets, and rising betas of domestic and foreign markets. Those phenomena are lowering risks associated with investing in emerging markets such as China. However, according to Bekaert and Harvey (2000, 2003), international diversification is becoming ever more elusive. Learning to cope with the implications of integration is therefor of definite necessity. 

The interest for return causality and, hence, predictability, is obviouslymotivated by proﬁt considerations of market participants. However, return and volatility spillovers also allow insights into the nature of cross-border ﬂows of information (e.g. King and Wadhwani, 1990). From the investors’ point of view, analyzing volatility sheds light onto asset risk (Merton, 1980), facilitates the valuation of ﬁnancial products and the development of hedging techniques (Ng, 2000), allows for accurate modeling of the error variance, and improves the forecasts of time-varying conﬁ-dence intervals and the efﬁciency of estimators (Poshakwale andMurinde, 2001). For academics, changes in volatility reveal the arrival of information, its assessment and degree of disagreement among traders concerning the news’ impact on asset prices, as well as the magnitude of the news’ assimilation by the market (Ross, 1989; Engle et al., 1990).

By examining the nature of return and volatility spillover between markets, insights can be made about cross-border information flow (King and Wadhwani, 1990). 

Investors in search of profit can also analyze volatility spillover to better understand the asset risk Merton wrote about in 1980. It can also help in the valuation of financial products and hedging techniques (Ng, 2000), gives modelers more to work with when modeling error variance, and augments forecasting abilities (Poshakwale and Murinde, 2001). 

**Theoretical foundation of spillover**

The co-movements of ﬁnancial markets has long drawn the attention of academics and prac-titioners alike. Markets follow each other, both in return and variance, due to the emergence of and reaction to information originating abroad. However, for news to travel across borders, trans- mission channels are required. Finance-related news transmission often occurs due to correlated information, i.e. macroeconomic news arrival in one country inﬂuences the value of domestic and foreign assets as far as there are real linkages between countries. Liquidity shocks, forcing mar-ket participants experiencing them to liquidate their portfolios also in other countries, represent another transmission channel. This effect is often strengthened by a wide application of portfolio strategies like cross-market feedback trading.

Thanks to decades of work, the theoretical foundation for spillover studies is strong and sturdy. One clear support is the transmission of information across markets. For example, when the People’s Bank of China announces a change in the reserve requirement ratio, local media will relay the news to foreign media, who then transmit it to the US. Across the Pacific, investors can then adjust their portfolios to reflect the new macroeconomic environment. The buying and selling that takes place in both China and the US are both resultant of the ratio change. (change this for RE market).

Liquidity shocks, which force investors to liquidate their portfolios in other countries, are another real linkage. This response is often amplified by the prevalence of portfolio strategies like **cross-market feedback trading** (XXX).

Further, investors are motivated to rebalance their global portfolios due to shifts in relative risk aversion driven by changes in asset prices (wealth effect), and cross-country hedging policies, which reveal their reaction to foreign news. Additionally, real economic linkages between coun- tries (due to foreign trade or investment) and common lenders constitute further potential channels for ﬁnancial spillovers (Kaminsky and Rainhart, 2000; Kodres and Pritsker, 2002; Pritsker, 2001, among others).

When asset prices change, investors may need to rebalance their global portfolios as their relative risk aversions change alongside. Furthermore, the real economic ties between countries such as foreign trade and investment serve another channel for financial spillover (Kaminsky and Rainhart, 2000; Kodres and Pritsker, 2002; Pritsker, 2001, among others).

However, technological progress lowering information and transaction costs for international investment, liberalization, direct competition on third countries’ product markets, and similarities in risk–return characteristics of emerging markets’ assets might result in signiﬁcant spillovers between emerging markets located on different continents, i.e. inter-regional spillovers. Again, the problem of the relative magnitude of intra- versus inter-regional spillovers has to be resolved empirically.

Direct competition between companies located in both countries can also contribute to financial spillover (xxx).

Even if local markets can fully incorporate the price-relevant information originating abroad, a temporary under- or overreaction due to information asymmetries and actions of speciﬁc investors like feedback traders is possible. Results of this study indicate that indeed factors such as limited access to and low quality of information, existence of feedback traders or chartist investors, investors’ behavior patterns such as herding and momentum trading, as well as non-trading, stale limit orders, or high transaction costs most likely contribute to extending the time needed by local emerging markets to fully absorb foreign news (e.g.Mech, 1993; De Long et al., 1990; Hong and Stein, 1999).

But even if investors were able to capture and incorporate all the relevant news coming from abroad, there may still be a temporary over or under reaction to the news. Furthermore, this may be further distorted by feedback or chartist traders (xxx). XXX found that the amount of time needed to absorb foreign news can be complicated by limited access to and low quality information, herding and momentum trading, or high transaction costs (e.g.Mech, 1993; De Long et al., 1990; Hong and Stein, 1999).

**This is then followed by empirical evidence**

Substantial literature exists on returns and volatility spillovers frommature to emergingmarkets (e.g. Bekaert and Harvey, 1997; Hu et al., 1997; Ng, 2000; Hashmi and Tay, 2001; Bekaert et al., 2005). Most importantly, Harvey (1995) reports that emerging market returns are, compared to their mature counterparts, more inﬂuenced by local (domestic) rather than global information. Bekaert and Harvey (1997) also ﬁnd a weak, but increasing, impact of global factors on domestic volatility on emerging markets, indicating a progressive integration of these markets into the world market. Applying GARCH methodology, Ng (2000) ﬁnds for six Paciﬁc Basin countries that foreign factors explain only a small fraction of stock market volatility in each country, indicating the prevailing role of country-speciﬁc shocks. Also Chelley-Steeley (2004) shows that markets in the Asia-Paciﬁc region are more integrated with each other than with the world, and that regional integration develops faster than the worldwide one. However, Karolyi (2004) argues that the speed of integration of emerging markets with the world is also remarkable, e.g. due to dual-listing of stocks in both developing and developed countries. Also, the results reported in Kim (2005) show substantial impact of the U.S. on Asian markets.

Harvey (1995) found that emerging market returns are more affected by domestic non-global news than mature markets. Bekaert and Harvey (1997) discovered that global factors are impacting emerging market volatility to a weak but strengthening extent, and point to integration as the cause. Several studies of Pacific markets found that regional factors had the greatest influence on shocks. 

Karolyi (2004) arguest that the speed of integration between emerging and developed markets is fastened due to the dual listings.

Kim (2005) reports significant impact of the US on Asian markets.

**Introduction to ARCH & GARCH models**

Campbell, Lo, and MacKinlay (1997, p.481) argued that “it is both logi-cally inconsistent and statistically ineﬃcient to use volatility measures that are based on the assumption of constant volatility over some period when the resulting series moves through time.”

XXX draws attention to the logical and statistical shortcomings of using constant volatility measures.

Bollerslev (1986) proposed a Generalized Autorregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, It is quite obvious the similar structure of Autorregressive Moving Average (ARMA) and GARCH processes: a GARCH (p, q) has a polynomial β(L) of order “p” - the autorregressive term, and a polynomial α(L) of order “q”- the moving average term.

Well said GARCH(p,q).

**Multivariate Simultaneous Generalized Arch**

Although economists have long been interested in the analysis of behavior under uncertainty, econometricians have only recently begun developing an analytical framework to deal with uncertainty. A central feature of this framework is the modeling of second and possiblj~ higher moments, as well. One of the most prominent tools used to model the second moments is due to Engle (1982). Engle (1982) suggested that these unobservable second moments could be modeled by specifying a functional form for the condi- tional variance and modeling the first and second moments jointly, giving what is called in the literature the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedas- ticity (ARCH) model.

This linear ARCH model was generalized by Boller-slev (1986) in a manner analogous to the extension from AR to ARMA models in traditional times series by allowing past conditional variances to appear in the current conditional variance equation.

Similar to the AR to ARMA extension, ARCH was generalized by Bollerslev in 1986.

**multi**

Multivariate ARCH models allow the variances and covariances to depend on the information set in a vector ARMA manner and are particu- larly useful in multivariate financial models (such as the CAPM or dynamic hedging models), which require the modeling of both variances and covari- ances.

The extension from a univariate GARCH model to an n-variate model requires allowing the conditional variance-covariance matrix of the n-dimensional zero mean random variables t, to depend on elements of the information set.

On the impacts of oil price ﬂuctuations on European

The use of equity sector indices is, in our opinions, advantageous because mar-ket aggregation may mask the characteristics, not necessarily uniform,of various sectors. Sector sensitivities to changes in oil price volatilitycan be asymmetric. Some sectors may be more severely affected bythis volatility than the others, depending on whether oil and oil-related products are an input or an output for the industry as well ason the indirect effect of oil prices on the industry, on the degree of com-petition and concentration in the industry, and on the capacity of the in-dustry to transfer oil price shocks to its consumers.

XXX believe equity sector indices are advantageous because they don’t mask characteristics as a market aggregation does. The argument lends support to the comparison of real estate indices in this study.

From a portfolio management point of view, identifying the heterogeneity ofsector sensitivities to oil implies that there are sectors which can stillprovide a channel for international diversiﬁcation during the periodsof large swings in oil prices.

This study could also be expanded to study the volatility transmission from China’s real estate sector to other sectors such as construction and white goods producers both in the US and China. The results may shed light on sector diversification.

GARCH-type approach has received a particular interest fromalmost all previous papers in modeling ﬁnancial volatility (Agnolucci,2009; Hassan and Malik, 2007;and Kang et al., 2009). It is commonlyaccepted that multivariate GARCH speciﬁcations such as BEKK, CCC orDCC models are more relevant than univariate models as far as we areconcerned by the volatility transmission issue amongmultiple ﬁnancialvariables.

The GARCH family of models has been chosen in nearly all prior attempts to model financial volatility ((Agnolucci,2009; Hassan and Malik, 2007;and Kang et al., 2009). When extending to the multivariate space, GARCH specifications including BEKK, CCC or DCC are commonplace.

**Price and volatility spillovers across North American**

This paper examines price and volatility spillovers across North American, European and Asian stock markets. The return spillover is modeled through VAR(15) in which ﬁfteen world indices, representative oftheir stock market are considered.

The sophistication of volatility spillovers ranges from simple bivariate normal to those aiming to capture asymmetric fat-tailed multivariate distributions. With the purpose of capturing same day spillovers around the world, XXX examine 15 world indices.

Volatility spillover is modeled through AR-GARCH incorporating the same day effect. In both return and volatility spillover, it is found that a particularindex ismostly affected by the indices which open/close just before it. Currently, the ﬁnancial markets are witnessing liberalized capital movements, ﬁnancial reforms, advances in computer technology and information processing. This trend is evident in both developed and developing countries. These factors may have reduced the isolation of domestic markets and increased their ability to react promptly to news and shocks originating from the rest of the world. As a result, the linkages between stock markets around the world may have grown stronger. International linkage of markets has major implications for domestic economies and for international diversiﬁcation. Strong linkage reduces the insulation of domestic market from any global shock whereas weak market linkage offers potential gains from international diversiﬁcations. Understanding short-run interdependence in returns and volatility across differentmarkets adds to insights on diversiﬁcationand hedging strategies.

Liberalized capital movements, ﬁnancial reforms, advances in computer technology and information processing.

A strong linkage indicates a smaller benefit from cross-border diversification. Understanding short-run interdependence in returns and volatility can add clarity to diversification and hedging strategies (xxx).

Over the past 15 years, there has been a growing interest among the portfolio managers in the emerging capital markets as they are expected to provide higher asset returns compared to the developed markets. However, with opening of the economies, the increasing integration between the emerging and the developed markets has led to information and sentiment spillover from one market to another. The listing of stocks atmultiple stock exchanges all over the globe also adds to integration of markets (Bennett & Keller, 1988)

Over the past 15 years, portfolio managers have been growing more interested in emerging markets’ higher expected asset returns. However, economic liberalization is fading away the benefits of diversification (xxx). The cross-listing of companies on multiple stock exchanges is hastening that process (Bennet and Keler, 1988). 

Understanding volatility spillover across markets is important because volatility is a measure of risk and helps in estimating the risk of internationally diversiﬁed portfolio. It is also important in executing hedging strategy, in asset allocation, and also in devising policies related to capital inﬂow in the market.

Volatility is a measure of risk, so understanding its transmission is important for estimating the risk of internationally diversified portfolios. It also carries implications for hedging strategies, asset allocation, and also in formulating policies related to capital inflows (xxx).

Interdependence among internationalmarkets has been studied in two broad contexts: interdependence in returns and interdependencein volatility.

International interdependence studies come in two flavors: interdependence in returns and volatility.

**Before/after euro**

Cheung and Westermann (2001) concluded that the spillover did not change between U.S and European market before and after the introduction of the EURO.

A study of volatility spillover before and after the introduction of the Euro.

In, Kim, Yoon, and Viney (2001) studied the volatility transmission among Asian countries during the Asian Financial Crisis period from1997 to 1998. They found reciprocal spillover between Hong Kong and Korea. Jang and Sul (2002) investigated the co-movement of Asian stock markets prior to, during and after the Asian Financial Crisis. They found that the co-movementamong the Asian markets increased during the ﬁnancial crisis period.

A study of volatility transmission between Asian countries both before and after the Asian Financial Crisis revealed that co-movements increasing during the crisis (Jang and Sul, 2002)

It is important to note that European indices are mostly correlated with each other and areaffected by NASDAQ lagged returns. In this analysis, the same dayeffect of return of indices is ignored.

**Volatility**

It is often argued that the information ﬂowacrossmarkets through returns (correlation in ﬁrst moment) might not be signiﬁcant and visible; however, they may have strong effect through volatility (correlation in second moment) a better proxy of information by Clark (1973), Tauchen and Pitts (1983) and Ross (1989).

Many argue that you cannot predict how returns will respond across different markets to the same piece of news (first moment correlation). Rather, the volatility response may be a better proxy of information (second moment correlation) (Clark, 1973, Tauchen and Pits 1983, Ross 1989).

**Price and volatility spillovers between the Greater China**

In this paper, we have examined stock market linkages between Greater China and the US and Japan in terms of volatility and price spillovers. It has been established that volatility spillovers are stronger than price spillovers between the Greater China markets and the developed markets of theUS and Japan. The dominance effect of developed markets overdeveloping markets does not show up in the present study.

According to XXX, volatility spillovers are stronger than price spillovers between Chinese markets and the US. However, the dominance effect of the US having a stronger impact on China than vice versa did not appear in the results.

Given various reasons for interest in dynamic relationships between returns and volatilities in different markets, it is not surprising that there has been a considerable research in this area. Early studiespredominantly focus on the developed markets.

Using a signal extraction model with GARCH processes, Lin, Engle and Ito (1994) examine the interaction of the US and the Japanese markets and ﬁnd that the two markets inﬂuence each other.

Wang and Firth (2004) test for return and volatility transmissions across four emerging markets of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Shanghai A and Shenzhen A and three developed markets of New York, London and Tokyo. Their empirical ﬁndings indicate that there exists a unidirectional contemporaneous return dependence of emerging Chinese markets on these developed markets, and bi-directional volatility spillover effects between the developed and the emerging markets.

Shenzhen A market!

Price movements of four emerging Asian markets were found to be dependent on New York, London and Tokyo, while volatility movements were found to be mutually dependent (Wang and Firth 2004).

**China evidence**

However, with most of such studies excluding the mainland Chinese market, the world's largest emerging market, 

the asymmetry found in return interactions and volatility spillovers may indeed, or at least partly, result from the asymmetry in the relative sizes of the developed market and developing market covered in the studies. Therefore, by including the markets of mainland China into the sample, along with those of Hong Kong and Taiwan that differ in size and openness, it provides us with unique opportunity to investigate the extent to which these markets are inﬂuenced by the developed markets regarding return and volatility transmissions.

XXX suspect that the asymmetry found in some return and volatility spillovers between China and developed markets may be partly due to the asymmetry in their relative sizes to each other. 

they adopt a two-step procedure and resort to a univariate model. **In the ﬁrst step, the unexpected returns for each market are estimated, which is then used in the second step to investigate the interdependence of returns and volatilities between the markets.** Therefore, the unexpected returnwould have been differentwere the interdependence taken into account. **Consequently, the two-step procedure is less efﬁcient and may potentially lead to distortions in the estimated interdependence between the markets**.

Some two step univariate approaches are less efficient and may distort estimated interdependence (xxx).

The ﬁndings of the present study, either offering new evidence or challenging the bulk of the previous research, can be summarized as follows. Firstly, volatility spillovers are stronger than price spillovers between the Greater China markets and the developed markets of the US and Japan. While there being evidence, which is at times weak, of interdependence in time-varying volatilities between these markets, there is virtually no links between these markets in terms of interdependence in price movements. Secondly, there is little evidence of an overwhelmingly dominance of the developed markets of the US and Japan over the emerging market of Greater China.

Volatility spillovers are stronger than price spillovers between China, Japan, and the US. Interdependent volatility movements do sometimes flicker up, but there are virtually no interdependent price movements (xxx). No dominant affect.

**BEKK**

However, even with GARCH (1,1) speciﬁcation, the above model is still impossible to estimate practically as it involves far too many parameters to be manageable, given that there are four variables to be estimated simultaneously in our case. Therefore, in this study,we choose the BEKKmodel as suggested by Baba,Engle, Kraft and Kroner (1990). The BEKK process guarantees that the covariance matrices are positive deﬁniteunder very weak conditions (Engle and Kroner, 1995).

BEKK assures that covariance matrices remain positive…?

**methodology**

The twomainland Chinese A share returns exhibit higher volatilities, with Shenzhen A being the highest among all. Further, the Ljung-Box Q-statistic for thetwelfth order in the levels and the squares of the residuals is reported in Table 2. 

You check the std deviation to comment on the volatilities. Then you use LBQ test for the “12” order, which 12 stands for lags.

  It clearly indicates no serial correlation in levels, but the squared residuals do show serial correlation. These preliminary tests reveal that, although the ﬁrst moment presents white noise residuals, the second moment exhibits strong autocorrelation in squared residuals, a property that will result in volatility clustering, justifying the use of time-varying variance models. Turing to the distribution of returns over time, all of the skewness statistics are signiﬁcant. The sign of the skewness varies across the markets, with two of them tilting to the left and the rest to the right, indicating that the returns are not symmetrically distributed. Moreover, all returns are characterized by statistically signiﬁcant kurtosis, suggesting that the underlying data are leptokurtic, that is, all series have a thicker tail and a higher peak than a normal distribution. So it is not surprising that the Jarque Beratestconcludes that all return distributions are non-normal.

**TESTS**

This then tells if serial correlation exists at any levels, and squared residuals. first moment white noise, second movement autocorrelation in squared residuals, which would indicate volatility clustering. Skewness significance, and the market tilts (left or right), indicating if they are symmetrically distributed. Kurtosis? Leptokurtic, that is, thicker tails and a peak higher than normal. Jarque Bera test than shows non-normal returns.

**Spillover Eﬀects Among the Greater China** 

As economic growth continues at an unprecedented level, stock markets in the Greater China region (Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan) are attracting the interest of interna- tional investors. stock exchange was formally established in Mainland China. Empirical studies on emerging markets in general indicate that they are becoming more inte- grated with the rest of the world over time. Common factors seem to aﬀect stock markets around the world. It is therefore of interest to look at whether emerging markets in diﬀerent regions are aﬀected by one another, or whether they respond mainly to domestic news and shocks. The main novelty in this paper is the application of multivar- iate volatility analysis to the markets in the Greater China re- gion. Very few studies have focused on the three markets in this region, and to our knowledge, none has appliedmultivariate volatility models that incorporate possible volatility spillover eﬀects to shed light on the dynamic relationships among the markets.

Chinese economic growth is attracting international investors to its markets. 

**Causes of spillover**

The level of integration, or how much a certain movement in one market tends to aﬀect the subsequent periods in other markets, is of great importance to investors and depends on factors such as direct regulatory impediments (capital controls, etc.) and changes in political and economic coopera-tion among countries.

How much a movement in one market transfers into other markets, indicating integration, depends on factors such as direct regulation such as capital controls, and changes in political and economic cooperation (xxx).

**<<History of china’s equity market section>>**

**Asymmetry** 

Before we move on to specify the model, we need to consider the possibility of asymmetric features in the volatility pro- cesses. Numerous studies have shown that many ﬁnancial time series respond diﬀerently to positive and negative shocks. For instance, in some markets, large negative returns tend to be followed by periods of high volatility, suggesting that positive and negative shocks may have asymmetric impacts on future conditional volatility. 

Black (1976) recognized this feature in market data and suggested that it may be a result of how ﬁrms are ﬁnanced. When the market value of a ﬁrm decreases, the debt–equity structure changes, leading to an increase in the debt-to-equity ratio (known as the leverage of the ﬁrm). This is known as the ‘‘leverage eﬀect.” Basic GARCH models can- not capture such asymmetric eﬀects, and it is therefore impor- tant to ﬁrst take a closer look at the behavior of the volatility. Engle and Ng (1993) proposed a series of tests for asymmetry in volatility, commonly known as sign and size bias tests, to be applied to the residuals of a basic GARCH(1, 1) model of re- turns data. When applied to the three markets as reported in Table 6, the asymmetry tests give a mixed picture. The Chinese market does not seem to show any signs of asymmetric eﬀects in the volatility process.

 

**Engle and Ng (1993) put forward the sign and size bias tests to check for asymmetric volatility. According to XXX, China’s market doesn’t show any signs of asymmetry. This suggests that the basic GARCH model, which does not capture asymmetric effects, is appropriate for this study.**

**Testing stock market linkages for Poland**

By using a four-variable asymmetric GARCH-BEKK model, we ﬁnd evidence of returns and volatility spillovers from the developed to the emerging markets. the emerging markets are weakly linked to the developed markets. The implication is that foreign investors may beneﬁt from the reduction of risk by adding the stocks in the emerging markets to their investment portfolio.

XXX found that emerging markets in Eastern Europe are weakly linked to developed markets, implying that foreign investors may benefit from diversification by investing there. 

**linkage importance**

The extent of the global linkage of emerging markets has great implications for their domestic economies and for international investors.While it improves access to the interna-tional capital markets, strong global linkage reduces the insulation of the emerging markets from external shocks, hence limiting the scope for independent monetary policy. From the perspec-tive of international investors, weak market linkage in the form of less than perfect correlation between returns offers potential gains from international portfolio diversiﬁcation, while strong market linkage or co-movement in returns eliminates the potential beneﬁts of diversiﬁcation into emerging markets.

Global linkages between emerging and developed markets improve access to capital markets. However, they also reduce insulation from external shocks, which reduce the independence of monetary policy (xxx).

Although global stock market linkages have been widely studied1 for the developed markets and some emerging markets in Asia and South America, research on the linkages of the emerging markets in Central and Eastern Europe with the developed markets is limited.

It is argued that if markets are integrated, an unanticipated event in one market will inﬂuence not only returns but also variance in the other markets. The analysis of volatility is particularly important,because it can proxy for the risk of assets. Scheicher (2001) models on both returns and volatility of the national stock indices of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic during 1995–1997 by using a multivariate GARCH with a constant conditional correlation.

Many argue that unanticipated events in one market can affect the returns and volatilities of other markets (xxx). Volatility can serve as a proxy for the risk of assets (xxx). 

**BEKK**

we are motivated to contribute to the studies by using a multivariate asymmetric GARCH with time-varying variance-covariance, i.e., the BEKK model (the acronym from synthesised work on multivariate models by Baba, Engle, Kraft andKroner) proposed by Engle andKroner (1995). 2 Due to its ability to examine linkages in terms of returns and volatility, theGARCHapproach is preferred to those only examining linkages in terms of returns.Apart fromallowing for time-varying variances and covariances, the asymmet- ric BEKK model to be used in this study can examine the cross-market volatility spillover effects and the asymmetric responses,

**data**

The stock markets in Frankfurt and the U.S. are considered to servewell as proxies for the regional and global developedmarkets, respectively,

The US market can serve as a proxy for the global market (xxx).

Following Syriopoulos (2004), Voronkova (2004) and Yang et al. (2006), we use the daily stock indices of the stock markets inWarsaw (WIG), Budapest (BUX), Frankfurt (DAX) and the U.S. (S&P 500) in this study. The stock indices are in local currency terms and their changes are thus restricted to the movements in the stock process solely, avoiding any distortions induced by the currency devaluations of the countries.

The indices are local denominated, so a change in their value only reflects movements in their prices.

We have removed the data of those dates when any series has a missing value due to no trading. Thus all the data are collected for the same dates across the stock markets and there are 1898 observations for each series.

The series only contains dates for which both indices were trading. They count xxx observations in total.

 

Fig. 1 presents the time plots of the series, which ﬂuctuate on a daily and longer term basis. The ﬁrst impression is that the indices of the two emerging markets follow a similar movement while DAX and S&P500 have a similar trend. It can be noticed that WIG and BUX suffered from some difﬁculties in the mid-1998 due to the Russian crisis.

This first impression suggests that the two indices follow similar paths. Of worthwhile note is the turbulence both embark on from 2008 onwards.

Fig. 2 displays the returns of the share price indices, the ﬁrst differences of the natural logarithm of the share price indices, during the period under study.

The price indices returns, the first differences of the natural logarithm of the share price indices.

The feature of high volatility of WIG and BUX is consistent with the observation by **Harvey (1995)** that emerging markets in Europe, Latin America, Asia, the Middle East and Africa exhibit high-expected returns and high volatility.

XXX confirm Harvey’s 1995 observation that emerging markets feature high expected returns and volatility.

the BUX index is most volatile, as measured by the standard deviation of 1.8%,

When measuring volatility with standard deviation, SZ proves the more volatile at X.X%.

**on normaliy**

The Jarque-Bera statistics reject the null hypothesis that the returns are normally distributed for all cases. The BUX and DAX indices have a negative skewness, indicating that large negative stock returns aremore common than large positive returns. In contrast, theWIGand S&P 500 indices are slightly positively skewed. Furthermore all the returns series are leptokurtic,having signiﬁcantly fatter tails and higher peaks, as the kurtosis statistics are greater than 3. GARCH models are capable of dealing with data displaying the above features.When modeling the non-zero skewness statistics indicate an ARCH order higher than one in the conditional variance equations. Subsequently, a GARCH(1,1) model should be preferred to an ARCH(p) model for the sake of parsimony.

Jarque-Bera test for normality. Both indices are negatively skewed, indicating that large negative shocks occur more often than large positive ones. The DJ is extremely leptokurtic at 14.9, while the SZ exhibits mild leptokurtosis, measuring at 3.7. Something about GARCH…

**Methodology**

The variable of interest in this study is the daily returns of the stock indices,which are computed as ﬁrst differences of the natural logarithm of the four stock indices.

**EXTRACTS2**

**Fat tails and asymmetry in financial volatility models**

Although the generalised autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH)model has been quite successful in capturing important empirical aspects of ﬁnancial data, particularly for the symmetric effects of volatility, it has had far less success in capturing the effects of extreme observations, outliers and skewness in returns. This paper examines the GARCH model under various non-normal error distributions in order to evaluate skewness and leptokurtosis. The empirical results show that GARCHmodels estimated using asymmetric leptokurtic distributions are superior to their counterparts estimated under normality,

According to XXX, the GARCH model performs poorly when capturing extreme observations, outliers, and skewness in returns. GARCH models capable of handling asymmetric leptokurtic distributions achieve superior results. Overall, the Student’s t-distribution performed best in XXX’s study.

Overall, the ﬂexible asymmetric Student’s t-distribution performs best in capturing the non-normal aspects of the data.

The key underlying assumption of most ﬁnancial models, such as the Black–Scholes option pricing model (BSM) and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), is that the (logarithmic) returns are independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) normal variates.

**Normality is a joke**

Unfortunately, the i.i.d. assumption about empirical returns underlying these ﬁnancial models is typ- ically not satisﬁed as ﬁnancial returns are not, in general, normally distributed. Even if the underlying returns were normally distributed, the returns of portfolios that use dynamic strategies or include options on these assets will not be [13]. Furthermore, investors view upside and downside risks differently, with a preference for positively skewed returns, implying that more than the ﬁrst two moments of returns may be priced in equilibrium. In short, the basic assumption of normality is highly suspect.

As pointed out by XXX, even if the returns process is normally distributed, chance may have it that the portfolios holding those assets may adopt options with non-normal distributions. 

A pervasive temporal feature of asset price movements is the conditional dependency in the second moment.

Since the suggestion of the Student’s t-distribution in [1], there has been an endless search beyond the normality assumption to model the empirical distribution of conditional returns. The main purpose of this paper is to examine alternative probability density functions (pdfs) for con- ditional returns, with particular emphasis on how well these capture fat tails and asymmetry. Such an empirical examination is important for ﬁnance practitioners as the shape of the conditional distribution also affects the means and variances, and hence the upside and downside probabilities of returns.

**Firm Market Performance and Volatility in a National Real Estate Sector**

We present empirical evidence using daily data for stock prices for 17 real estate companies traded in the Sao Paulo, Brazil stock exchange, from August 26, 2006 to March 31, 2010. We use the U.S. house price bubble, financial crisis and risk measures to instrument for momentums and reversals in the domestic real estate sector. 

XX uses the U.S. house price bubble and financial crisis to instrument for momentums and reversals in Brazil’s real estate sector.

The real estate market in the U.S. has passed through a transformation in the last 30 years that made it one of the culprits of the recent financial crisis. In contrast, the real estate market of the country of Brazil has been booming in the last few years, most prominently recently, but at the same time has been very volatile. Thus, the financial crisis in the U.S. provides a fertile natural experiment to understand the economic influence of the U.S. in Brazil, in particular in the Brazilian real estate sector.

The US real estate market has transformed significantly over the past 30 years, which left it vulnerable to the recent financial crisis. China’s real estate market differs, in its explosive growth.

In particular, the real estate sector index was the hardest hit loosing almost 80% of its value between May and December 2008.

The real estate index was hit the hardest. Between only May and December 2008, nearly 80% of its value disappeared.

We have daily data for stock prices for 17 real estate companies traded in the Sao Paulo stock exchange, Bovespa, from August 26, 2006 to March 31, 2010. This period encompasses the main events in the U.S. regarding the housing market bubble and the financial crises that followed.

The period encompasses x y and z.

**GARCH in question and as a benchmark**

Good criticisms of GARCH. You can just opt for SMA, given M. also talk of model evolution. 

GARCH hardly outperforms the simple moving average model, given M. However, determining M requires the GARCH models.

Model evolution.

GARCH models of volatility are ubiquitous. Over the past twelve years, the GARCH industry has produced an almost infinite number of volatility time series from an extremely wide range of return series. The main purpose of this paper is to revisit the notion of volatility. Although we stop just short of questioning the necessity (and certainly the success) of GARCH, we demonstrate that for at least one type of data-long term interest rates-it is possible to  essentially reproduce GARCH volatility time series with simple moving averages of deviations from mean return.

**history**

Volatility of returns is considered by researchers and investors alike to be a proxy for risk, for uncertainty. It is central to CAPM and its extensions. Volatility is a key input parameter in classic derivative pricing models. It is more than reasonable to periodically ask, as we do here: “How should we measure volatility?” Through the 1970s researchers were relatively content to consider volatility constant, at least over the short to near term. This changed in the early 1980s due to two factors: (1) the proliferation of computer power; (2) and the work by Engle (1982). Engle unveiled a model (ARCH) which allowed for volatility to be time-dependent. The industry launched by Engle grew rapidly and matured. Over the past fifteen years, researchers have attempted to model nearly every conceivable financial time series by ARCH, GARCH and their many cousins. The success rate has been declared high. Although there have been some voices in the background asking questions about the lack of rationale or theory to support GARCH modeling, it is a fact that the coefficients of GARCH models are often statistically significant. This reality has provided comfort to GARCH modellers, and has encouraged the development and application of the industry.

history

**today**

It should be understood at the outset that at the present time there is no universally accepted definition of volatility.

We declare at the outset that we have no expectations of “improving” GARCH estimates of volatility; indeed, we offer no measure of whether or not one time series of volatility is an improvement over another.

Two simple methods and why they probably fell out of favour….

Fig. 2 shows the monthly changes in Great Britain long-term rates. How volatile are the displayed returns? The answer to this question certainly depends upon how we chose to calculate volatility. At the coarsest level, we can use Eq. (1) to calculate the sample variance as a measure of (time-independent) volatility: 6’ = 0.39 = 3.9%. Of course, even a cursory glance at Fig. 2 shows that using a constant measure of volatility is unsatisfactory; the visual evidence in this case clearly indicates that in some sense volatility is changing over time. There appear to be “bursts in volatility.” How can we capture these bursts?

For small values of M, we can expect SMA(M) to be extremely responsive to changes in “volatility”; for large values of M, we do not expect such responsiveness.4 As mentioned in the introduction, we do not (currently) have a theory-based method to determine M for a given time series of returns.

In many cases M of ARCH(M) was found to be unwieldingly large. 

our intention here is to make the point that the time series of volatility calculated using SMA(M) looks very much like the time series of volatility estimated using GARCH modeling, and that in many cases it does so for a wide range of M’s.

modern question

**correlated results**

Except for scaling, the GARCH volatility time series displayed in this figure looks a great deal like the SMA(10) volatility time series displayed in Fig. 4. Perhaps the simplest way to compare the two obtained volatility series is to calculate their correlation; it is 0.950. We find the size of this correlation surprising in view of the fact that GARCH is ostensibly a much more sophisticated method of estimating volatility. All the discussion that is to follow aside, we conjecture that the majority of GARCH

We find it both ironic and interesting that we are now able to come up with at least a technique, if not a theory, that can be used to determine M, and that our technique uses GARCH, an extension of SMA, to do so! The method is simple. We define: For a given return series, MOPrimum is that M which maximises the correlation between the volatility time series calculated using GARCH(l,l) and the volatility time series calculated using SMA(M).

We ask: which of the two illustrated series best captures the volatility of returns ? We think it would be a challenge to present a reasonable argument that answers this  question.8

We have demonstrated in this paper that simple moving average calculations of volatility aren’t so bad; indeed, they’re rather good-at least compared to a “vanilla” GARCH(I,I) model-with the added proviso that one is allowed to use GARCH to help select the number of moving average terms. Under these circumstances, simple moving average calculations of volatility are highly correlated with GARCH volatility. The selection of an appropriate number of terms to use in a simple moving average calculation of volatility remains problematic in the absence of a benchmark volatility series such as GARCH(I,Z).

**How asymmetricisU.S.stockmarketvolatility**

Following large positive return shocks, asymmetric time-series models predict an increase in volatility (albeit a much smaller increase than following a negative shock of the same magnitude), but both implied and realized volatilities generally fall sharply.

Models predict that following a large positive shock there will be an increase in volatility. However, in asymmetric models a large negative return shock will result in a higher magnitude increase in volatility.

This paper examines how asymmetric the volatility responses to surprise return shocks are for the aggregate U.S. stock market

We examine and compare the behavior of three volatility measures: (1) the predictions of asymmetric time-series models, such as the EGARCH and GJR models, (2) implied volatility, speciﬁcally the Chicago Board Option Exchange’s VIX index, and(3) realized volatility.

It is well established that positive and negative return shocks have differing impacts on aggregate U.S. stock market volatility in that volatility tends to be much higher following negative return shocks than following positive return shocks of the same magnitude. This has been documented repeatedly by estimations of asymmetric time-series GARCH-type models, such as Nelson’s (1991) EGARCH model and the GJR model of Glosten et al.(1993).

It’s well documented that positive and negative shocks bear different impacts on volatility. Popular models which estimate asymmetric responses include Nelson’s EGARCH (1991), Glosten et al.’s GJR model (1993) and the GARCH-BEKK (I think). Refer to focardi’s book. And the forecasting with GARCH book.

**Asymmetry**

Based on the insight of the early volatility persistence literature that volatile markets tend to follow volatile markets, early time-series models, ARCH and GARCH, incorporated the assumption that volatility increased equally following positive and negative shocks. However, it soon became apparent through the estimation of more ﬂexible models, such as GJR and EGARCH, that stock volatility (especially aggregate U.S. stock market volatility) is asymmetric in that negative return shocks have a greater impact on subsequent volatility than positive return shocks.

The two main theories of this observed asymmetry are the leverage and feedback hypotheses. In the volatility feedback hypothesis of French et al. (1987), Schwert (1989), and Campbell and Hentschel (1992), the asymmetry is due to a risk premium. If a return shock causes expectations of future volatility to rise, this rise in risk causes investors to require a higher expected future return, causing current prices to fall (a negative return). This feedback effect partially offsets a positive return and augments a negative return. In the leverage hypothesis of Black (1976) and Christie (1982), since a large negative return shock means a decline in aggregate equity values, leverage at the average ﬁrm is increased.

The leading two theories on the asymmetric behavior are the leverage and feedback effects. As noted by XXX, the feedback effect of French et al. (1987), Schwert (1989), and Campbell and Hentschel (1992), the asymmetry results from a risk premium. That is, if a return shock leads investors to predict higher volatility ahead, they’ll expect higher returns to offset the higher risk, and forcing prices down. XXX went on to explain that this feedback effect partially offsets positive returns and augments negative returns. The leverage effect first popularly documented by Black in 1976 and later by Christie in 1982, blah blah blah.

Thus for the same volatility of assets, equity volatility should increase. Conversely, a positive return shock implies a decrease in leverage and lower volatility.

Bekaert and Wu (2000) argue that part of the reason for the asymmetry in aggregate market returns, as well as an explanation for why aggregate returns are more asymmetric than ﬁrm returns, is that ﬁrm returns are more correlated in down markets. Thus if ﬁrm level volatility is unchanged, when the market declines, aggregate stock market volatility rises because the covariances rise. Recently, Avramov et al. (2006) have presented a fourth hypothesis. They argue that following a positive return, selling activity is dominated by informed or contrarian investors tending to reduce volatility. Following a negative return, selling is supposedly dominated by uninformed or herding investors leading to an increasein volatility.

As documented by XXX, Bekaert and Wu (2000) found an additional explanation for asymmetric returns, based on the observation that returns are more correlated when markets fall. Ceteris paribus, as markets decline, covariances rise. Avramov et al. (2006) meanwhile argue that positive returns induce well informed and controlled trading, whereas negative returns induce uninformed or herd trading, which ups volatility.

**Time series models**

To the authors’ knowledge, all estimations of such models for aggregate U.S. stock indices ﬁnd a reverse-J shape in which future volatility tends to: (1) rise strongly following negative return shocks, (2) rise weakly following positive return shocks, and (3) decline following periods in which surprise returns are close to zero.

XXX consistently found that US stock index volatilities tend to rise following a negative return shock, rise weakly following a positive one, and fall in the absence of return shocks.

**How globally contagious was the recent US real estate market crisis**

Contrary to expectations, it is found that the relationship of the US market with the other markets following the US real estate market crisis cannot be characterized as one with contagion effect. Its relationship with the other markets is rather characterized by dependency behavior that prevails regardless whether the markets are under distress or not.

Surprisngly, XXX found that the US real estate market didn’t exhibit a contagion effect with other markets following the crisis. Rather, crisis or not, there is a dependent behavior that prevails.

In the course of interactions between markets, co-movements or spill-over effects occur which are driven by fundamental factors such as trade linkages, capital ﬂows and banking linkages (Glick and Rose, 1999).

Those interactions, co-movements, or spillovers are driven by fundamental factors including trade and banking linkages, and capital flows (Glick and Rose 1999).

**Contagion**

However, these spill-over effects may increase beyond the level called for by fundamentals as a consequence of the reaction of markets to non-fundamental factors which may drive them to exhibit herding behaviour. In this situation, the co-movements are said to contain contagion effects.

But when spillover cannot be explained as an in-kind response to fundamental factor, and instead appear to follow a different spirit, herding behavior is said to drive them. When non-fundamentals drive co-movements, there is said to be a contagion effect.

It is important to determine whether the spill-over effects or co-movements between markets contain contagion effects since conta- gion, being the result of non-fundamental factors, indicates the existence of market inefﬁciency.

With ﬁnancial markets being globalised, there are now more interactions and interdependence between markets and with markets experienc- ing crisis situations, there is a suspicion that co-movements between markets consist of contagion effects.

It is claimed that real estatemarketsmay be highly susceptible to contagion as these markets have become globalised over the past decade (Bardhan and Kroll, 2007).

According to Bardhan and Kroll (2007), real estate may easily catch the contagion due to an increasingly globalized marketplace. 

**Crisis**

First, the recent US real estate market crisis has precipitated the still on-going global ﬁnancial and economic crisis. Second, the US real estatemarket is the largest and most globalised in the whole in the whole world (Bardhan and Kroll, 2007). Given the severity of the crisis and the great publicity it attracted worldwide and theworldwide reach of the USmarket, onewould expect that the distress situation of the US market would have created signiﬁcant contagion effects on other markets.

Bardhan and Kroll (2007) also point out that since the US is the largest and most globalized real estate market in the world, and coupled with how strong the financial crisis was in gathering worldwide attention, one should expect the crisis to bear considerable contagion effects. China, which often stands beside the US and EU in economic headlines, boasts the latter trait.

**Contagion and real estate markets**

Conceptually, contagion is deﬁned as spill-over effects or co- movements between markets that are caused by non-fundamental factors.

Contagion defined.

Real estate markets are now becoming globalised and integrated (Bardhan and Kroll, 2007). This globalisation has been mainly driven by the internationalisation of real estate investments arising from the introduction of common real estate investment vehicles Eichholtz and Kok, 2007). For example, from 2001 to 2006, cross-border in- vestments tripled to US$ 116 billion, which represents 20 percent of all property investment worldwide (Hobbs, Chin and Topintzi, 2007).

Eichholtz and Kok (2007) explain real estate contagion in that real estate investments such as common real estate investment vehicles are becoming increasingly internationalized. Hobbs, Chin and Topintzi (2007) revealed that between 2001 and 2006, cross border investment jumped three fold to account for 20 percent of all total property investment.

Foreign capital inﬂows into a country can now easily ﬁnd their way into the real estate market. In addition to the globalisation of investment, other factors that have signiﬁcantly contributed to the globalisation of real estate markets are the internationalisation of real estate service providers, the development of more transparent international benchmarks or standards in real estate across the globe such as the recently published Real Estate Transparency Index of Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL, 2008), the reduction of political barriers, and the liberalisation of capital markets which also give rise to new ﬁnancial instruments which allow foreign investors similar or almostequal footing with local real estate investors (Eicholtz, et al., 2009).These developments lead into what La Porta, et al. (2000) callfunctional convergence of markets.

Real estate service providers are also going global (XXX), and new financial intruments which give foreign investors nearly the same footing as local investors are pushing that internationalization (Eicholtz et al., 2009).

As a consequence of this globalisation and integration, it is expected that there will be increased co-movements and contagion among real estate markets internationally. However, real estate is non-tradable and real estate markets have been found not to respond rapidly to international shocks (Bardhan et al., 2007). Hence, if contagion in real estate markets is present, it will have to arisethrough the other channels in terms of investor liquidity, portfolio  rebalancing and information channel. Hence, it is not clear to whatextent would international contagion affect real estate markets.

These developments lead XXX to expect tighter real estate co-movements and contagion in the future. But you can’t trade real estate on an exchange, and the markets don’t quickly respond to international shocks (Bardhan et al., 2007), factors which may dampen contagion.

Very few papers have investigated the issue of contagion among real estate markets globally, particularly in relation to the recent US real estate market crisis. This limited number of studies has come up with mixed results. Fry et al. (2008) investigated, among others, contagion among the real estate markets of the US, the UK, Australia, Germany, Japan and Hong Kong using a contagion test that relies on changes in higher moments.

Other real estate contagion studies.

**Many contagion tests**

Other commonly used methods for testing contagion include: (1) the use of the variance-covariancematrixes in an ARCH or GARCH context to investigate spill-overs between markets (see for example Hamao, Masulis, and Ng, 1990), (2) the examination of changes in a cointegrating vector between countries (see for example Granger et al., 2000; Longin and Solnik, 1995), and (3) the investigation of the determinants of different markets’ susceptibility to ﬁnancial crises (see for example Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz, 1996; Forbes, 2004). 

There are several popular options to test for contagion including GARCH, and testing for co-integration.

Forbes and Rigobon (2002) pointed out that the increase in correlation between markets after the crisis could be biased if the volatilities also increased. They therefore calculated correlation coefﬁcients that are adjusted for the changes in volatilities.

Forbes and Rigobon (2002) therefore adjust the correlation coefﬁcients to remove the bias created by the change in volatility between periods when there is no change in the true regression slope coefﬁcient

**Data**

In this paper we test for contagion effect from the US real estate market to Australia, Japan and the UK real estate markets. As stated earlier, it is not clear theoretically as well as from the literature as to the extent by which contagion effects can characterise the interaction in real estate markets.

For purposes of diversiﬁcation, real estate serves as an important component of investors’ portfolios due to its many attractive characteristics such as its stable and predictable increase in value over time, its strong performance yet low correlation vis-a-vis such traditional asset classes as stocks and bonds domestically and across countries, and, especially, for its ability to act as an inﬂation hedge which has been documented,

Real estate is commonly included in investor portfolios so as to diversify holdings. Real estate is attractive as an investment class since it generally bears stable and predictably increasing values with time, boasts low correlation with stocks and bonds, and can function as an inflation hedge (XXX).

**Using REITS as proxy**

An alternative method for investing in real estate that overcomes these disadvantages of physical real estate is investing through real estate securities. As pointed out by Yunus (2009), since the advent of securitization in the early 1960s and especially over the last decade, REITs (real estate investment trusts), REOCs (real estate operating companies) and private indirect vehicles have emerged as viable alternatives to domestic commercial real estate ownership, making real estate available, albeit indirectly, to a wide audience. With institutional investors’ increased demand for these securities, coun- tries other than the US have also started to introduce tax-transparent REITs or REIT-like structures throughout the world, thereby fostering the growth and indirectly promoting the transparency of the global real estate securitiesmarket.

Investing in real estate securities as opposed to the physical asset is advantageous. For the purposes of this study, the equities segment of real estate allows for higher frequency data, and serves to better capture contagion. If frequencies are too low, much of the volatility can fade away before being registered. 

Quoted on a daily basis.

In this paper, we therefore focus on the securitised (equities) segment of the real estate market. By doing so, we are able to use higher frequency data than what can be obtained from the direct real estate market. This is advantageous in the investigation of contagion since contagion is often transmitted between markets in short time horizons. The data employed in this study consist of publicly traded real estate stock price indices, quoted on a weekly basis, from Datastream for the four real estate markets under study,

**The crisis**

The beginnings of the crisis can actually be traced back to the middle of 2005 when home repayment delinquency rates actually started to pick up which then continued to increase in 2006 (Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, 2008). By the middle of 2006, housing prices in the US began to decline and sub-prime mortgage foreclosures started to increase (OFHEO, 2008a). Mortgage lenders with re-purchase provisions for their loans were called upon to undertake repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2006 (Krinsman, 2007) but at the same time, investment banks started shutting down credit lines to independent mortgage lenders (Tavakoli, 2008). This therefore resulted in a funding difﬁculty for those lenders who were undertaking repurchases of delinquent mortgages (Greenlaw et al., 2008). 

It was not, however, until the summer of 2007 that this situation developed into a full-blown crisis. This was precipitated by deterio- rating quality of U.S. subprime mortgages, a credit, rather than a liquidity event.

XXX says that the housing crisis didn’t become full-blown until the summer of 2007.

**Good ARCH test – with table!**

The continuous return of each variable is used. The datawere tested for normality and ARCH effects. As can be seen from Table 1, the null hypotheses of normality and no ARCH effects were strongly rejected.

The tests show that the data set is non- normal and ARCH effects prevail, especially for the entire sample. These diagnostic tests point to the fact that the standard methods based on the assumption of normality with constant volatility would not perform accurately.

**REIT volatility prediction**

Empirical results indicate that the GARCH-SGED model is superior to the GARCH-N and GARCH-ST model in forecasting REIT volatility in the United State, for all forecast horizons in which model selection is based on MSE or MAE. Meanwhile, the DM-tests further conﬁrm that volatility fore casts using the GARCH-SGED model are more accurate than those generated using the GARCH-N and GARCH-ST model in all cases. These ﬁndings demonstrate the signiﬁcant inﬂuences of both skewnessand tail-thickness on the conditional distribution of returns.

US REIT volatility is best captured with the GARCH-SGED model, followed by the GARCH-N and GARCH-ST. Skewness and fat-tails were therefor significant.

**Why REITS**

Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a crucial ﬁnancial com-modity. According to the National Association of Real Estate Invest- ment Trusts (NAREIT), the market capitalization of REIT rapidly grew from 1494.3 millions in 1972 to 438,071.1 millions in 2006 and that REIT offer an attractive addition to investment portfolios to provide diversiﬁcation. As a result, REIT is becoming a more common part of an investor’s portfolio and is more frequently traded. It is therefore, important that their price movements be understood and that a comprehensive picture of the return and volatility structure of REIT.

Regarding the issue of volatility forecasting, a large volume of literature has emerged on modeling and predicting volatility in ﬁnancial markets since accurate volatility forecasts of ﬁnancial as- sets are crucial inputs for derivatives pricing, calculating value-at- risk and devising hedging strategies. Accordingly, numerous researchers have recently become involved in modeling and esti- mating volatility.

Due to the importance of accurate volatility modeling, numerous researchers have recently been employed in the modeling and estimation of volatility (XXX).

A number of papers have examined interlinking REIT involatility (Devaney, 2001; Stevenson, 2002), they have utilized uni- variatemodels whereas this paper extends the analysis of volatility dynamics by using a multivariate GARCH framework. Stevenson (2002) examines volatility spillovers with regard to monthly REIT returns.

REIT spillover studies…

Unfortunately, REIT market volatility has seldom been modeled and forecasted. However, Hsu, Miler, and Wichern (1974) and Hagerman (1978) found that the empirical distribution of asset returns is also signif- icantly non-normal. Non-Gaussian time series thus have begun to receive considerable attention and development of forecasting methods is gradually underway. **Owing to the increasing volatility, accurate volatility forecasts have become a crucial issue.**

Due to the increased volatility seen in the real estate market, it’s become crucial to better understand its nature.

The ﬁnancial literature has long been aware that ﬁnancial returns are non-normal and tend to exhibit leptokurtic and fat-tailed distribution (Mandelbrot, 1963 and Fama, 1965),

(2000) also indicated that return is indicated by of excessively fat- ter tails and pronounced skewness and a consequence of strong volatility clustering. Hansen (1994) indicated that numerous empirical studies have found evidence that conditional modeling with asymmetry1 in the volatility process cannot capture the skew- ness and tail-thickness of ﬁnancial returns distribution. Conse- quently, Hansen (1994) applied the skew-t distribution to capture the skewness and the excess kurtosis and Theodossiou (2001), Lehn- ert (2003) and Bali (2007) proposed a skew generalized error distri- bution (hereafter, SGED). Consequently, this study examines which model is better using estimated and forecasted volatility, comparing the SGED and skew-t distribution models, and comparing models with skew and excess kurtosis to those without.

**GARCH**

Bollerslev (1987) proposed the generalized autoregressive con-ditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model, which explicitly mod-els a time-varying conditional variance as a linear function of previous squared residuals and of its past values in econometrics and empirical ﬁnance; therefore, this study examine the relative ability to predict out-of-sample volatility of GARCH models with alternative speciﬁcations in terms of returns distribution for REIT returns.

**DATA**

The data for this present study consists of observations regard- ing the daily data on the prices index for All REIT were obtained from the NAREIT for the period January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2006. Daily closing prices for a total of 1670 observations are ob- tained from the Bloomberg database.

Many time series data of ﬁnancial assets appear to exhibit auto-correlated and volatility clustering. The most popular statistical modeling approaches to ﬁt this stylized facts are GARCH model-ing.3

The most popular statistical model to capture auto-correlation and volatility clustering is the GARCH.
