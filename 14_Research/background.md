BACKGROUND:

A bubble is defined by the fact that it will burst, and that it has escaped fundamentals. 

ECONTALK: “Situation where there are **a sequence of price rises for a speculative asset which generates a social epidemic, generates contagion, certain ideas that become prominent**. **New era stories, envy, trading successes** become prominent in people's ideas, **sense of your self changes for a while,** become more self-confident because you think you've discovered your investing genius. Why does it end? **It can't go on forever.** Prices are rising because people expect them to rise further. Someone will want to sell. **Idea of a bubble goes back hundreds of years.”**

“**Recent real estate bubble went on for 6 years.** Not going to change over night. Can get in for a short time safely. Only those left in at the end get hurt. **Transactions costs** of moving in and out of the housing market are much higher than the stock market.”

“Two ways to think about the current housing market: bubble that pops, systemic effects, or that it may have had some bubbly aspects but the crisis part is in the subprime market where **foreclosures play a human side to the story**, securitization.”

“General assumption, received conventional wisdom, was that **home prices can never fall**; distorted into home prices are the best investment ever; **everyone should get leveraged.** Leverage pushed it up to a tremendous rate of profit. **Infomercials** at night; rang true. **Idea that there could be a crash in home prices didn't sound real**. Famine or another black plague. Sounded like a money machine even to rational people. **Failure to think about the bubble.”**

**“Economies with financial markets have more booms and busts, goes with the advantages of markets.”**

**Fed blame? PBoC blame?** 

“High prices or low prices? When they are going up, everyone says it's great; but they forget the fact that a lot of people can now buy houses that they couldn't previously. What's the advantage of high home prices? Want to see economic growth, so **you want to see incomes outpacing house prices**.”

**Urbanization – just hit 50%.**

“**Employment is positively correlated with home prices in a region: Michigan decline is related to the decline in the auto industry, which didn't have such a boom**. Some places like Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Diego, Miami are areas with rapid price decline and were places that had big booms. **Housing boom was substantially mirrored in places that have had housing bubbles before.”**

**“Markets are driven by stories.** The idea that you are going to get rich in real estate isn't plausible in Milwaukee or Toledo, OH. Celebrity areas stimulate people's imaginations. Economists loosely throw around that fundamentals are driving everything. Can throw a lot of variables into a regression and make anything fit, called data mining.”

“Case-Shiller home price index. In late 1980s, Carl "Chip" Case rediscovered a method that had been used as early as the 1920s, improved it. **Repeat sales home price indices.** Most prominent index was the median home price. Problem with that is that the mix of homes changes, so sometimes a lot of homes on the west side of a town are selling and other times the east side. **Volatile series.** **Instead, created an index that focused on the same set of homes.** **Astonishingly smooth over time.** **Incredible inefficiency of the home market. Stock market goes like a random walk; housing market goes in trends for years. Partly because of transactions costs; but also because nobody sees the data.”**

**“Trend in U.S. has been toward dramatically larger houses. Once they are in the index it's controlled for.”**

“**2007 when magnitude became palpable, we saw securities down dramatically, domino effect.** Bernanke testified when Bear Stearns went under, could cause contagion that would spread. Justified Fed action, enhanced the power of the Fed, less than disinterested spectator. How do we know that we stood on the brink of a crisis? We don't know. We do know that there have been terrible crises in history, like the Great Depression.”

 

This study relied on an index to proxy real estate prices. However, a better proxy for real estate prices would be a repeat sales home price index such as the Case-Schiller Index, as opposed to the value weighted one used. Unfortunately, to the best of this author’s there exists no such index in China to this day, and certainly not one with several years of trading history.
