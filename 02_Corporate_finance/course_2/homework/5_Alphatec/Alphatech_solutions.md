# Case: Alphatec Electronics

## How much is management to blame for ATEC’s problems? Bad management; Bad business; or Bad capital structure?

- Management was a curse. 
  - “Determined guy” or “delusional guy?”
    - Overambitious in the expansion.
    - Flew the overburdened company straight into the ground. 
    - No consideration of failure. 
  - Burning records.
  - Actions also probably aimed at covering up theft.
  - Company is rotten on the inside, so why hire the auditors?
  - Were family board members qualified?
- Tech company, financial expert board
  - Mismatch of expertise and knowledge.
  - Meetings only in Thai, neglecting chief operators 

- Too much Bad business.
  - Bring city to the plant or bring plant to the city?
  - Alphatec investments questionable. 
    - High tech wafers
    - Telephones
    - Tool and plastic die
    - Water production
  - Invested in $1.2 billion plant before completing leadings steps.
  - Company only leaned up with crisis.
- Capital structure lopsided
  - Though investing for long term, no risk management.
  - $50 million in sales dwarfed by $373 million in debt.
  - All assets bet on economic stability.
- Again, management was a curse. 
  - Should have better business forecasting skills.
  - Did not exploit government ties to learn of FOREX situation.

## As one of ATEC’s banks, would you have voted for the its February 1998 out-of-court restructuring proposal?

- Need to consider what ATEC’s creditors would get under liquidation vs. under the restructuring plan
- ATEC has a large number of creditors 
  - Must determine how much value each class of creditors would receive as a fraction of what they were owed initially under the two options
  - Must also look at what form this value would take (i.e. cash, new debt, stock, etc.)

- Senior unsecured creditors are better off with the restructuring plan – they would get 12-13% on the dollar compared to 0% under liquidation (again, on the dollar)
- Senior secured creditors are less interested in whether the firm remains in business than junior creditors (or unsecured creditors) as the former have better chances of recovering their money
  - Secured creditors would get 20-25% on the dollar under liquidation
  - Assume that ATEC’s largest creditors (i.e. Krung Thai Bank, Bangkok Bank and Union Bank of Bangkok) are secured creditors

- What would secured creditors get under the restructuring plan?
  - Depends on the future performance and value of ATEC (i.e. there is an uncertainty)
  - Must consider how the two long term options will affect ATEC’s value (Alphatec II vs. NSEB)
  - There is also an uncertainty about the firm’s current true value due to the financial irregularities
- By converting 95% of their outstanding debt into equity, creditors are exposed to a risk
  - If the plan does not work out well and ATEC cannot get back on its feet, the company might eventually liquidate and, as shareholders, they might get nothing

- ATEC’s net profit has been continuously increasing throughout the period of 1991-1996 (with the exception of 1996 when it fell) à exhibit 3
- It’s working capital has been negative in the last years à exhibit 3
  - Leads to a financial pressure on the company and an increased borrowing
- ATEC’s cash flow statement shows that most of the company’s cash comes from borrowing (2,057.5 million baht in 1996). However, ATEC uses a great portion of its cash for investing activities.

- Other things to consider:
  - Charn had withdrawn 3.95 billion Baht from the company without proper authorization
  - In 1997, the baht fell by 25%, pushing many firms that had large US – denominated debt into financial distress 
    -  ATEC’s debt was mostly baht – denominated

**Bottom line: Alphatec’s main problem seems to be the lack of cash (not its operating activities)**

- This problem is solved through the pre – financing of A/R

- ATEC’s financial projections seem to be quite good according to exhibit 10
  - Free cash flow of 1,117,692,000 (186,282,000 US x 6) for the period of 1998 to 2002 with Alphatec II
  - Free cash flow of 2,633,070,000 (438,845,000 US x 6) with Alphatec Shanghai and NSEB (2,374,332,000 US only with NSEB)
- Thus, it is worthwhile for the creditors to convert their outstanding debt into equity
  - Great possibility that they would earn more than 20-25% on a dollar through this option
  - Creditors do not necessarily have to wait longer (under the old law, they could spend as long as 15 years in court arguing their rights if they decide to liquidate the firm)

**Conclusion:** Assuming that the numbers in the financial statements are not completely distorted by the accounting irregularities, we would have voted for the out-of-court restructuring proposal

## As one of ATEC’s banks, would you have voted for the its modified bankruptcy reorganization plan?

***Yes!***

- ATEC has a large number of creditors 
  - Each class of creditors would receive more than they would have under the previous options.
- This plan gives ATEC a better shot at maintaining its profitable business line (exhibit 3).
- The plan helps overcome it’s working capital problem (exhibit 3).

- The new plan should be accepted
  - The banks benefit from the new tax write-off.
  - They can avoid long and expensive legal battles.
  - The two investors will inject $40 million for long term expansion, with $10 million possibly going to working capital.

Assets of old ATEC would be transferred to AHC who would own 99.9% of equity of ASP and 100% in ATS.

At the same time, ASP would take over ATEC’s main core business operations in Thailand.

AIG & AB would own 80% of AHC while creditors would own the remaining 20%.  Thus, AHC would be all-equity financed.

From this pie graph, we can see that $10 million would be converted into equity of AHC. At the same time, AIG and AB are trying to invest directly in AHC as well.

## Why are AIG and AB willing to invest in ATECH?

- They strongly believe that overseas claims will also be protected by the new organizational form.
- The restructuring of the company may increase its own value
- They may also be optimistic about company’s future prospectives. 

- If AIG and AB are able to finalize the negotiations for the large infusion of equity to AHC, then AIG and Investor AB would own 80% of AHC who owned 99.9% of ASP and will be all-equity financed.
- AIG and AB also believe that corporate restructuring could increase the value of the company ATEC. 
- ATEC could be given some stake in the reorganized ATEC instead of holding the claims.
- The Bankruptcy Law of Thailand prohibited only domestic claims from being made. Thus the probility of overseas claims not being protected by the new organizational form could lead to a decrease of the company’s value.
- The ASP company’s future profitability performance will have the positive/negative impact on the performance-linked obligation and the secured debt. 

## What were the problems of Thailand’s old bankruptcy law? Would you change anything in the new law?

### Problems of Thailand’s old bankruptcy law:

No equivalent to the US Chapter 11 bankruptcy code like allowing a debtor company to seek restructuring.

It only provided for liquidation of distressed assets. 

Creditors faced long-drawn out legal battles, sometimes as long as 15 years. 

It did not have provisions for recovering laundered money from former management or any party to such actions thereof. 

### The New Bankruptcy Law in Thailand:

It was enacted as it was a requirement placed by the IMF to bailout Thailand. 

The new law again did not have any provisions to seek recovery from former management of a company or any party to such actions thereof. 

**Recommendation:** A provision should be made to seek recovery so that affected parties can follow through with legal proceedings, if they are not deterred by the long time taken in the courts.

The new law makes provisions to appoint an Official Planner and a Plan Executor. This might lead to agency problems. 

**Recommendation:** Checks needs to be put in place to ensure mitigation of any agency problems. 

## How would the outcome have differed in the US? In the UK?

The outcome would differ in the US and in the UK due to the key differences between corporate insolvency under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the "Code") and the English equivalent, the Insolvency Act 1986 ("IA").

- Liquidation: 
  - In England, the two most common procedures are a creditors' voluntary liquidation and a compulsory liquidation.
  - In the US, if the court found IA is appropriate, it would make a winding-up order in respect of Alphatec.

- Administration: two major difference
  - First, in England, specific conditions are required before Alphatec can begin the process. Conversely in the US, there are no tests or conditions before Alphatec can file Chapter 11. 
  - Second, in the US Alphatec would remain under existing management’s control. In England the court would appoint an administrator, like in Thailand.
  - Creditors in England would be in a better position than those in the US, in that they could gain access to Alphatec assets as soon as insolvency proceedings begin.
  - The IA recognizes "preferential creditors" as having preferential collection rights which come after fixed charges but before floating charges.

- Corporate insolvency is more frowned upon in the UK than in the US, where failure is more often considered to be just a misfortune rather than a wrongdoing. Alphatec’s reputation would be more tarnished in the UK than in the US.

As a result, the UK would make a faster sale of Alphatec assets to satisfy creditors claims. In the US, creditors would need to wait through a longer salvaging process, like in Thailand.

The UK tries to compensate with a more rescue friendly culture, such as simplifying debt claim procedures. This could aid Alphatec in escaping through its crisis.
