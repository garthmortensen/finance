# Case: Perrier, Nestle and The Agnellis

## Questions

1. What are the Agnellis control rights on Perrier on January 21, 1992? How much capital do the Agnellis own in Perrier? How do they structure their ownership? Which problems do the Agnellis face in their control of Perrier? Comment on the Nestle alliance in its effort to obtain control of Perrier.
2. There are various parties involved in the battle for corporate control for Perrier. In your judgment, and based on the case facts, who are the insiders and who are the outsiders in the French corporate system?
3. Is the bid for Perrier too high? In undertaking the valuation, assume the following:
   - The valuation of Perrier takes place in December 1991.
   - The base year is 1992 (take an average of the years 1990 and 1991 as the values for 92).
   - Revenues are defined as sales plus other revenues.
   - Perrier’s current all-in-cost of borrowing (in French Francs) is 12%, and Nestlé’s, 11%.
   - Starting with the end of the calendar year 1992, i.e., year 1, Nestlé expects to obtain cost synergies by lowering Perrier’s non-depreciation expenses to 85% of revenues (from current levels).
   - Net working capital is 12% of sales.
   - Base-case sales for Perrier are expected to get back to a steady growth rate of 5.5% per year. Starting 1992, Nestlé expects revenue synergies to generate an annual additional gain of 2.5% in Perrier’s revenue growth rate, for the next ten years.
   - Nestlé plans a one-time set-aside in 1992 of FF600 million to cover restructuring charges and expenses associated with the benzene scandal.
   - Exceptional income equals exceptional charges, going forward.
   - Nestlé expects that new capital expenditures will equal 2% of sales. New capital expenditure will be depreciated on an eight-year straight-line basis.
   - New depreciation is based on eight-year, straight-line, on new capital expenditure. Old depreciation is assumed to be maintained at 1991 levels of FF718 million.
   - The market risk premium for Nestlé’s investors is 7%, and Perrier’s marginal corporate tax rate is 42%.
   - The terminal growth rate is 5%.
   - If the bid is successful, Nestlé will sell Volvic to BSN for FF3.05 billion.
4. Suppose the two court decisions turn out in Nestlé’s favor. How will this affect the shareholdings of the Agnellis and their allies? Has Nestlé won the battle? Why or why not? What likely outcomes do you anticipate with respect to the EU antitrust case against Nestlé?
5. What are some of the similarities and differences in the Anglo-American and French markets for corporate control (in particular, look at Exhibit 9 of the case)?
