2. Growing demand: 17,000 megawatts per year through year 2000, and
insufficient domestic sources call for foreign investment

## What is the right cost of capital for the various equity options? Measure and explain the cost of capital for each equity option

### CHINA

We used re = r0 + (r0 – rD)(D/E)(1-Tc) to obtain the levered cost of equity

- ro = 15%
- rD = 8%
- Tc = 30%, 33%, 40%

Therefore, the cost of equity is 21%,21% and 20%, respectively

WACC = Cost of Debt (1-Tax Rate)*(Debt/Total Capital) + Cost of Equity (Equity/Total Capital)

Since we have three different scenarios for the tax rate, the company’s WACC is 12.51%, 12.26%, and 11.68%, respectively.

### US

Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + ß(Market Risk Premium)

RF = U.S. Government LT Bond Yield or 8.09%

RM-RF = S&P 500 Long – term market premium or 4.73%

ß = 0.52, which is the beta of the Electrical Power Generating Industry in US

Cost of equity = 10.55%

Cost of debt = HPI’s cost of debt in China + estimated premium

rD = 8% + 2% = 10%

Thus, WACC = 8.59%,8.42% and 8.03%, respectively (for the different tax rate scenarios)

### HK

Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + ß(Market Risk Premium)

RF = Prime Rate in Hong Kong or 7.75%

RM-RF = 13.05% (Hong Kong Hang Seng Index Market Premium)

ß = 0.52 

Thus, cost of equity = 14.54%

rD = HPI’s cost of debt in China + estimated premium or rD = 8% + 1% = 9%

WACC = 9.98%, 9.83% and 9.49%, respectively

![image-20201220130149550](./images/image-20201220130149550.png)

After calculating the WACC for the US, we also assume that the terminal growth rate will be stable at 7% for HPI, and the change in net working capital is 0.

Thus our valuation for ADRs is about $16.48 per share.

## What implementation strategy would you suggest? Present your recommendation on whether, how and why HPI should have proceeded with this issue. 

**We believe that HPI should proceed with the US issue.**

Our Justifications:

1. HPI presented an attractive investment opportunity to international investors.
2. According to the Cost of Equity (Ke) and the WACC that we have calculated, the US markets offer the lowest Ke and WACC.
3. HPI required $4.5 billion to finance their future expansion plans. However, their internal source of financing was enough.
4. Additional Advantages: 
   1. Bigger market size
   2. Improved valuation 
   3. More international exposure and visibility
5. Chinese ADRs offer diversification opportunities to US investors.

## Would you have recommended to buy stock in this company at all? Why?

We have a price of $16.48 per share based on Discounted Future Cash Flows. 

For the ADR issue, we consider a 15% discount on the calculated share price. 

We consider the discount to account for country risk and,

Unfamiliarity of US investors with the Chinese laws and companies in general. 

We believe that the ADR should be issued at $14.01.

## Given the current international investor environment (and not in 1994), what steps could HPI and the Chinese government take to make it easier for firms from China to raise capital internationally?

### Necessary steps Huaneng might do to attract global investors to increase its success in global capital market:

1. **Establish a sound financial system and reporting records.** Foreign investors will not build confidence for Huaneng until it presents a sound financial mechanism. 
2. **Maximize the utility of existing assets.** To maintain its financial stability, financially speaking, Huaneng should use properly its assets such as plants, equipment, network with government, thus making Huaneng more attractive to get more financial support from global capital market.

### Ways Huaneng might take to raise capital abroad: 

1. **Direct listing and indirect listing**. Directly list to foreign securities market by shares, or other derivative financial instruments, to the local stock exchange for listed transactions. 
2. Indirect listing overseas

### Actions government might take:

1. The country should ensure brokers operate well and remain competitive. They are the crucial element binding domestic companies to international markets. The government could push for joint ventures, easier access to labor and visas and offer tax preferential policies.
2. However, as domestic brokerages differentiate themselves in strength and experience; it is important for the government to promote the financing of domestic enterprises listed overseas. 

First, China's financial institutions, especially brokers, are still protected and not active in the international financial markets. Under global competition, the government should enact policies in favor of domestic brokerages and foreign securities firms to compete on an equal footing. While nurturing the domestic firms growth, they should also be urged to compete. 

Second, to encourage overseas investment banks and securities firms to participate in the issuance of B shares, H shares, N shares and S shares. Later, create conditions to promote the intervention of Chinese-funded brokerage owned brokerage competitiveness and business development capabilities.

Third, to allow foreign-owned brokerages in the Mainland to set up offices or branches in other forms, and the territory of China and foreign brokerages branches should be welcome to enjoy the same business treatment, which cultivates sustainable development.
