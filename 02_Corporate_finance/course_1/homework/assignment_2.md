## Part 1

### Exercise 1

The cost of equity capital describes the cost associated with raising new funds from e.g. existing shareholders for new investments. Under CAPM the required rate is a function of risk free rate, the market premium and the beta, whereby the beta is a measure of risk contribution. The individual beta describes the volatility / risk contribution of the particular company to the overall beta of the market portfolio. The main points are debt/equity ratio, average interest on debt, tax rate and beta. In practice you have to consider that betas change with leverage, that beta for private companies are not readily available, that not enough data to estimate beta is available and that beta might change over time.

The IRR for the project is 23,10%

### Exercise 4

a)    Company A has a cost of equity of 22% and therefore will actually lose money. It has to discount PV with 22% and therefore will lose € 1,1 million 

b)   Company B has a cost of equity of 18%, this means that it needs to discount its investments at 18%. It will therefore have an NPV of € 1.1 million. The company should make the investment.

| The company should go for project C  because it has the best PI, NPV, IRR and the smallest Payback Period. |                            |        |        |                                                              |

B.) How is it possible that the decision to replace the old machine has a positive NPV:

\-     If the required rate of return of the company is below 8,41 % the NPV will turn positive. Then the company would take advantage of the sale and the new purchase because of the tax advantage of the depreciation of the new machine. The depreciation is a non-cash expense but it will reduce taxes paid which is a cash outflow

### Exercise 5

a)    Value of unlevered firm = (75000*0,72)/0,18=300000

b)   APV = NPV + T.B = (75000*0,72)/0,18+ 16000*0,28 = 344800

c)    Rc = Ro + B/S(1-ta)(ro-rb)= 0,18 + 16000/(344800-160000)*0,72*0,08 = 0,22987

d)   LCF/Rs = (75000-16000)*(1-0,28)/0,22987= 184800
