# Bancorp Santander

## How would you rate the corporate governance of Sovereign? Be specific about the CEO, the board of directors, and other governance factors.

As characterized by Ralph Whitworth, Sovereign Bancorp had a pre-Enron board in a post-Enron world. From the evidence provided in the case, the corporate governance of Sovereign cannot be considered strong. Even when Relational accused Sovereign’s board of breaching its fiduciary responsibility, the justifications given by the CEO were weak.

The CEO and he board clearly appeared to have ignored the interests of shareholders while protecting their own. As given in the case, Sovereign significantly lagged comparable peer institutions in a variety of financial metrics, including net interest margin, return on assets, and return on equity. The market recognized this poor performance by assigning Sovereign low price-to-book and low price-to-earnings ratios.

The loans given to directors and officers, the contracts with companies owned by Sovereign directors, high director pay, etc. are some of the examples that show the board was not following sound corporate governance principles. Even when CEO Jay Sidhu retired, his severance package and other benefits went into the millions of dollars. Also, it is significant to note that he retired soon after the announcement that Sovereign might be sold to Santander.

The Santander deal also raised a lot of questions, which were pursued by Relational. One significant part of the deal was the fact that Santander had veto power over the removal of Sovereign’s CEO, which meant that whosoever was in cohort with Santander would never be removed as CEO, even if shareholders demanded it. The Santander deal was not approved by the shareholders and neither were any of its provisions. Santander was given very generous terms in the deal that clearly did not reflect the shareholders’ best interests. An example of the fact is that, if Santander chose to purchase the entire company in the future, Sovereign would not solicit proposals. Also, if an unsolicited proposal is received, Santander would have the right of first negotiation for 30 days and a right to match and beat any third party proposal.

Overall, we believe as stated above, that the corporate governance followed by Sovereign Bancorp was not sound and there are several reasons to believe that they did not always work in the shareholders’ best interests.

## What is your assessment of the Banco Santander transaction?  Was this transaction in the best interest of Sovereign shareholders, or do you believe it was a “sweetheart deal” for Sidhu and the board of directors?

Based on execution alone, the Banco Santander transaction was a mess that no shareholder would want to pay for. But it was only a growing pain. Before Relational stepped in with a 7.3% stake and called for changes, Sovereign was in poor order. Relational, interested in getting Sovereign back in shape, began acting as a watchdog for other shareholders.

Enter Santander. The Spanish bank managed to narrowly limbo under shareholder approval laws, twisted into a position where it could buy more shares without a challenge, and scooped up other benefits as well. In turn, Sovereign played its own cards by executing an all cash offer, another transaction that shareholders had no say in. To top it all off, Santander wanted veto power when it came to removing Sovereigns CEO, Sidhu. Later, Sovereign dodged shareholders by delaying the annual meeting until after the deal could be agreed on. A major restructuring, and vote free.

The companies’ behaviors appear awkward and suspicious. If the deal was beneficial to shareholders, they would have approved. So why, other than to go against their interests, work so hard to deny them a say? It is not our purpose to solely naysay the deal. This deal was too sweet.

However, Sidhu is in fact right to say that shareholder approval is costly. But so were the lawsuits that Relational and Sovereign were tossing at each other en masse.

Relational managed to cut board compensation in half, (though some of that pay is justified by its stock performance and board meetings). Furthermore, it prompted the NYSE to step in and tone down the deal between Sovereign and Santander. Said another way, without intervention, Sovereign would have been a runaway carriage leaving shareholders in the dust. Relational pulled back on its reigns.

After months of expensive legal battles and with all compromises made, Santander still bought up to the 24.99% limit, clearly indicating this deal was sweet too begin with.

Later on, with 4 new board members, Sidhu and his companions eventually stepped out, costing shareholders more than $42 million. Today? Good news for shareholders. Sovereign, a subsidiary of Santander, enjoys a stock price of $25.6.

## Do you believe shareholders should have had the right to vote on the Banco Santander transaction? What is your assessment of the NYSE rule and how it was applied?

Under the terms of the arrangement, Santander would purchase a 19.8% stake in Sovereign with the option to increase its stake to 24.99% during the two year period following the deal.  While this transaction was consistent with the regulations of the NYSE; as the investment made by Santander was for less than 20% of the current outstanding shares, it was certainly unethical on the part of the management and was structured in a way as to avoid the requirement of shareholders’ approval.  According to section 312.03(d) of the NYSE manual, however, stockholders’ approval is required “prior to an issuance of securities that will result in a change of control of the issuer”.  When we consider the option of Santander to increase its stake to 24.99% as well as its other privileges like board representation and veto rights, we can see that this transaction actually leads to a change in the control structure of Sovereign. Having two members on a board of directors that consists of seven (according to exhibit 5) would certainly give Santander a lot of power.  It would have a lot of influence over the business operations and strategic direction of Sovereign. Moreover, this arrangement would reduce the percentage ownership of existing shareholders, like Relational, and thus it should not be made without their approval.

In addition to the option to increase its stake at Sovereign, Santander was also given the option to acquire the former company at preferential terms. Sovereign need not solicit acquisition proposals from any third parties and this was clearly against the interests of shareholders as better offers might be disregarded.  In case Sovereign had unsolicited proposals from other firms, as previously stated, Santander would have the right to first negotiation for 30 days.  The terms of the agreement favour this particular company, which might not be the best one for Sovereign. Even if Santander did not have preferential terms, an acquisition decision is a great change for the future of every company and should not be taken without considering shareholders’ views on the matter.

In our opinion, the NYSE rule was not very efficient in reducing Santander’s power and was still quite unfair to Sovereign’s shareholders.  Although Santander would have to get the approval of Sovereign’s shareholders before exercising a vote of more than 20%, the company would still have two members on the board of directors and it would own at least 20% of the votes on every major decision of the company. Thus, it would still have a lot of power.  The NYSE should have considered the issuance of treasury shares before the deal and not once the deal was done.  In a way, the NYSE helped Sovereign to restructure the deal in order to get it through.  More importantly, the exchange changed the ruling a few months after the Banco – Santander deal and decided that treasury shares would be included in the calculation of the 20 percent threshold level. If the NYSE had made this amendment before the deal, Sovereign’s shareholders would have had the chance to vote and, as a result, there is a great possibility that Santander would not have become a large shareholder at all. 

## How successful was Relational in achieving its stated objectives?  Do you believe Relational was satisfied with its results?  Do you believe their efforts paid off for investors?

As an active investor, Relational was concerned over its investment in Sovereign. Guided by its objective of “adding value through responsible stewardship”, and targeting Sovereign’s low return, Relational had to launch a campaign to lead the company into a better state of management. To judge how successful they were in its efforts, we have to look at its original objectives:

\1. To reduce the self-dealing transactions (such as payment of rents on property owned by directors).

\2. Restructure the board and increase the number of independent board members.

\3. Bring the bonus and compensation of directors to a reasonable level, and change the way they decide their bonus by themselves.

\4. Get rid of Mr. Sidhu as he was not working in the shareholders’ best interests and was proving to be incapable of producing good financial results

\5. Improve the market performance through which it will enjoy the benefit of market value enhancement.

And the results? The alleged self-dealing transactions as claimed by Relational, Sovereign maintained were in accordance with laws; and the payment to directors had already been significantly lowered; Mr. Sidhu maintained his position as the CEO until his retirement, when finally, the two parties entered into a mutual agreement and Relational gained a seat on the board and another independent director was going to be added to the board as well. This appeared reasonable. However, as Mr. Sidhu had gained some stakes in Santander, which had two positions on the BOD, Relational’s original intended objective to improve the structure of the BOD remained controversial. Last but not the least, the market performance of Sovereign deteriorated.

We don’t know what the real intention of Relational was; which could have been as follows:

\1. To make short term profit by improving the market performance of Sovereign

\2. To act as an unfriendly shareholder by launching proxy fight and then greenmailing.

\3. Truly engage in the operation and decision making to seek long term profit.

Therefore, it is hard to say if Relational’s original objective was achieved, and to what extent. One seat on the BOD plus one independent director, as well as some changes such as lower compensation for directors; were some of the positive outcomes.  However, as huge compensation followed Mr.Sidhu’s resignation, the shareholders probably did not feel benefited through this campaign, and in addition the performance of Sovereign was deteriorating.

## To what extent do you think that hedge fund activism adds efficiency and improves corporate governance and to what extent does it detract from them?

To some extent, hedge fund activism does greatly increase market efficiency by getting a board position in the target company, offering their own strategies for improving both earnings and share price, and even  improving the board structure.  In this case, Relational can be considered as the activist who owned initially 7.3% in Sovereign Bancorp. 

From the results, we can see that Relational did help improve Sovereign’s corporate governance by accusing the latter of an unreasonable board structure and an illegal agreement with Banco Santander Central Hispano SA, which resulted in changes.  

But there is not much evidence that institutions as a whole have been effective activists, from the perspective of being able to institute changes that increase shareholder value. Often the reason can be traced to conflicts of interest between institutions and the company.  In addition, board members may be so nervous about their personal liability that they have to capitulate, even when they disagree with the actions demanded. And, at times, they may also think that the activism is no different from the greenmailing and corporate raiders who once have the seats in the board of the company, the self-dealing might happen. They will probably try to replace top executives, ask for more dividends and even liquidate the company for short term gains.

In this case, as a minority shareholder, Relational attacks Sovereign constantly, and Sovereign can’t focus on its core business line - banking. Instead, it expends a lot of time and energy fending off the attack. The bank has to spend bags of cash to hire consultants to defend itself, and enters numerous lawsuits. When Relational attacks the bank about its real estate and lawn service connections to its board members, the bank loses credibility and reputation. The bank in turn needs to expend more money to recruit consultants to deal with the series of lawsuits filed by Rational, which lags Sovereign’s efficiency in the short-term.

The evidence can be found in terms of the fluctuation of the stock price at that time. For example, in May 2005, Whitworth met with Sidhu to outline his concerns. In addition, he demanded that Sovereign reconstitute its board with more independent directors. If it refused, Whitworth threatened to launch a proxy battle for board seats. This piece of news seems to have gyrated the stock price during that period and thus harmed the bank.

Hedge fund activism can either improve or detract from efficiency.  On one hand, hedge fund activism plays an internal or external governance role (they give target company strategies and advice to improve their company structure), it is quiet useful and good for a company in the long-run.  On the other hand, there does exist some activists who focus only on short-term opportunities and gains.  They aim to have several seats in a company’s board, with which they can easily influence the company’s decision-making, the company’s dividend policy or even the company’s future, for long- or short-term performance.
